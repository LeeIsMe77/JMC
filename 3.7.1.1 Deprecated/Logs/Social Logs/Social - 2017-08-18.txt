09:53:01: You chat 'Eeek!'
09:53:06: Eek chats 'hi'
09:53:16: You chat 'Good morning.  How are you today?'
09:55:51: Eek chats 'what's the deal with Klogroth?'
10:12:12: You chat 'In what way? :O'
10:12:26: Eek chats 'is he part of something? Or just there?'
10:12:33: Eek chats 'does the key to steeldoor exist somewhere?'
10:13:16: You chat 'Erm, I'm not sure about that.  I'm not too familiar with quests and things anymore.'
10:13:25: You chat 'I DO know that he is part of a quest, as I found out yesterday.'
10:13:40: You chat 'He apparently is looking for serpent scales or a snakeskin or something. :)'
10:13:42: Eek chats 'hai quest?'
10:13:46: Eek chats 'oh, interesting'
10:14:08: You chat 'Precisely what I thought.  I'd imagine it has to be a decent reward, as the whitie rewards are pretty nice.'
10:14:59: Eek says 'I killed him for fun. Was curious if he had the steeldoor key.'
10:16:25: You say 'Yeah, I'm pretty sure this question arose a few months ago from Kenny.'
10:16:35: You say 'Or maybe longer, when Lhuths were moved back here.'
14:08:41: You say 'open'
14:10:26: Ranak chats 'baham!'
14:10:36: Ranak chats 'magus still alive!'
14:10:50: You chat ':P'
14:11:02: You chat 'I was idle in Magus since 7AM this morning on Atomos.'
14:11:12: You chat 'Congrats on 20, btw. :O'
14:11:17: Ranak chats 'hahahahahahaha, and thanks'
14:11:23: You chat 'Kinda funny.'
14:11:30: You chat 'Eek actually logged on early.'
14:11:36: You chat 'Kinda like he was scouting it out. :P'
14:12:09: Ranak chats 'not the same person tho'
14:12:32: You chat 'Oh well!'
14:12:44: You chat 'The plus side is he's alive. :P'
14:13:48: You chat 'I've had such a fun day at work today. :O'
14:16:36: Ranak chats 'i'm guessing that's sarcasm?'
14:16:40: You chat 'Nossir.'
14:17:24: You chat 'Recently, I've been doing a lot of redundant work.'
14:17:32: You chat 'I've been bored with it, really.'
14:17:49: You chat 'Today, I got tasked with fixing something that was way broken, but in the process it gave me the ability to re-write it from the ground up.'
14:18:04: You chat 'Thing is a piece of work.  I really enjoyed it. :O'
14:18:14: Ranak chats 'LOL! well grats!'
14:18:18: Ranak chats 'nothing better than having fun at work'
14:18:56: You chat 'This functionality was originally designed to pull data from SQL Server... it was kind of borked from the getgo.  I made it completely generic, so we can do so from OLEDB and ODBC as well.'
14:20:27: You chat 'Which, if that means nothing to you, it means we can query things like... access databases, excel spreadsheets, 30 year old pre-Y2K databases I dread, delimited text files, etc. :P'
14:20:55: Ranak chats 'that's awesome man'
14:21:59: You chat 'Granted, I should probably actually test it before I brag about it. :P'
14:24:07: Ranak chats 'testing is for testers'
14:24:18: Ranak chats 'just whip it out and call it user error'
14:25:42: You chat ':P'
14:25:47: You chat 'I suppose you're right.'
14:30:33: Ranak chats 'so that was weird'
14:30:38: You chat '?'
14:30:45: Ranak chats 'a guy i went to high school with works at my company at another store'
14:30:56: You chat ':O'
14:31:03: Ranak chats 'and he walked through and i chatted withhim'
14:31:40: Ranak chats 'not bad, just weird'
14:32:16: Ranak chats 'rather he works at A store, i work in the main office'
14:32:25: You chat 'It's always weird seeing people from youth as an adult, especially when they end up working with you, so to speak. :P'
14:32:30: Ranak chats 'right?'
14:32:47: You chat 'I completely understand.  When I went to work for my dad many years ago as an Electrician'
14:33:00: You chat 'He actually had someone I knew from elementry school employed.'
14:33:11: Ranak chats 'yup.  that's weird lol'
14:33:25: You chat 'Hah, then it turned out he had this other guy employed whom I had just started sleeping with his sister.'
14:33:42: Ranak chats 'that's REAL weird =|'
14:33:54: You chat 'What's even more weird is someone the topic of his sister came up'
14:33:57: You chat 'And I stayed silent'
14:34:10: You chat 'Then all of a sudden, the other guy, Pat, looks at me'
14:34:17: Ranak chats '...'
14:34:22: You chat 'and in front of Tim, her brother, Pat yells "Dude, OMG! You fucked her!"'
14:34:30: Ranak chats 'dude'
14:34:34: Ranak chats 'you made the right move'
14:34:36: Ranak chats 'you keep your trap shut'
14:35:03: You chat 'Definitely.  :P He was a cool guy though.  Never had any issues with him, enjoyed working with him.  His sister was short-lived.'
14:35:13: You chat 'But not because of him. :P'
14:35:39: Ranak chats 'hahaha well and really, people grow up and lead adult lives'
14:35:48: You chat 'Sometimes. :P'
14:36:04: Ranak chats 'i mean, literally every parent that has grand kids knows their kid was banging'
14:36:06: Ranak chats 'so...'
14:36:21: You chat 'Lol, you're right.'
14:36:39: You chat 'And really, it'd be unreasonable to assume your child has never sexed.'
14:36:49: You chat 'Sexed.  I enjoy that word.'
14:37:01: You chat 'Think I need to go do adult things outside with this cigarette. :O'
14:37:01: Ranak chats 'you made it up!'
14:37:08: Ranak chats 'haha'
14:46:30: Ranak chats 'i'm feelin this spec'
14:46:32: Ranak chats 'less resists'
14:46:37: Ranak chats 'huge wolves take 3 bolts'
14:46:50: You chat ':O'
14:46:59: You chat 'You're still killing huge wolves? :O'
14:47:03: Ranak chats 'meat =P'
14:47:07: You say 'open'
14:47:16: Ranak chats 'also since i'm awfully afk, i tend to kill whatever i come across'
14:47:24: You chat 'Fair enough!'
14:47:30: Ranak chats 'OB: 38, DB: 42, PB: 57, Spe'
14:47:33: Ranak chats 'be jealous'
14:47:37: Ranak chats 'of my 99 defsum'
14:48:05: You chat 'Lol'
14:48:09: You chat 'I actually am. :P'
14:50:34: Ranak chats 'i'm 0 for 2 on butchering the big snake near dfr'
14:50:49: Ranak chats 'man i feel like i can actually kill shit now with my spec'
14:51:12: You chat 'It's a lovely feeling. :P  Have you had any full mage lhuths?'
14:51:25: Ranak chats 'nicci is 36m and irma is 30'
14:51:28: Ranak chats '30m'
14:51:43: You chat 'Irma Gerd!'
14:51:49: Ranak chats 'good last name!'
14:53:20: Ranak chats 'though it takes longer since i don't sleep mana anymore'
14:53:28: Ranak chats 'not unless i'm in a safe safe spot'
14:53:59: You chat 'Yeah, it's a pain hiding from others. :P'
14:54:16: Ranak chats 'oh after you left yesterday i went to kill wights to get L20'
14:54:19: Ranak chats 'and on the way i saw a corpse'
14:54:25: Ranak chats 'tracked a ranger into terra'
14:54:33: Ranak chats 'hit him with 1 spell and he fled the fuck out and ran'
14:54:36: You chat ':O On lhuth?'
14:54:39: Ranak chats 'i was like lol i'm level 20'
14:54:48: Ranak chats '1 second of fighting me and he'd have torched me'
14:55:23: You chat 'So I typically high-tail under 1 situation, sometimes 2.'
14:55:33: You chat 'A) If I'm XPing someone questionable, or I'm not practiced to PK'
14:55:41: You chat 'Or B) I'm definitely not a high enough level to PK.'
14:55:56: Ranak chats 'yeah if i'm with someone questionable i'd definitely think about it'
14:56:00: You chat 'Or I guess if I'm in an area that I just shouldn't be in. :P'
14:56:07: Ranak chats 'but i'll fight till hurt almost every time'
14:56:12: Ranak chats 'no matter who i'm on'
14:56:31: You chat 'That's a difficult thing to do with my characters, because most are mages with 120-130HP at legend.'
14:56:37: Ranak chats 'HAHAHA'
14:56:38: You chat 'Meaning at the time of engagement, I had less than that. :P'
14:56:39: Ranak chats 'so hurt is 1 hit'
14:57:02: You chat 'Though also, my "high tailing" is normally run 10 rooms away and see if they hunt.'
14:57:02: Ranak chats 'a preppable poison man'
14:57:03: Ranak chats 'i love it'
14:57:12: Ranak chats 'i hunted this guy about 20 rooms'
14:57:15: You chat 'Unless it's a ranger, which I can't keep tabs on them entering my room.'
14:57:19: Ranak chats 'then i killed terra'
14:57:22: Ranak chats 'since he had it wounded'
14:57:26: You chat ':P  Guess he already stabbed it!'
14:57:30: Ranak chats 'got a phial and scrap'
14:57:35: You chat ':D'
14:57:51: You chat 'So here is an interesting thing I'd like to try.'
14:58:00: You chat 'Get a squad of lhuths who are nearly full mystic.'
14:58:13: You chat '3-4 lhuths on mystic at one time... should be able to kill mobs.'
14:58:18: Ranak chats 'yup'
14:58:54: You chat 'Granted... getting 4 lhuths on at a time will be hard.'
14:59:02: You chat 'Leveling said lhuths would be VERY difficult.'
14:59:08: Ranak chats 'getting 4 27t lhuths will be BRUTALLY hard'
14:59:15: Ranak chats 'i have a 30m 20t =P'
14:59:30: You chat 'That may be the best way to go, but I see 20T losing concentration and getting fucked up a lot.'
14:59:44: Ranak chats 'definitely, they'd need to go 27 or so'
15:00:11: You chat 'It may work out decently if there was a true buffer lhuth (minus the whole weapon skills thing)'
15:00:18: You chat '27w 20R lhuth'
15:00:25: You chat 'A mage for damage'
15:00:26: Ranak chats 'how would you level it?'
15:00:29: You chat 'And 2 mystics.'
15:00:41: You chat 'At least parry split would guarantee people will hit things, you'd think.'
15:00:50: Ranak chats 'consider though, that harads are coming soon'
15:01:09: You chat 'I think it would be cool seeing lhuths be just straight casters, with a few mystic skills. :P'
15:01:29: Ranak chats 'aren't they just straight casters with a couple mystic spells?'
15:01:43: You chat 'Well right now, they have mind block and resist. :P'
15:01:52: You chat 'But those skills are used outside the realm of mystics'
15:02:21: You chat 'I'm referring to like, inside/revive.  Probably all that would be needed.'
15:02:36: You chat 'Don't need offensive skills.  They're nice, but not needed.'
15:03:36: You chat 'I'd still expect all healing to come from mage.'
15:03:54: You chat 'I wouldn't expect any damage output from curse, unneeded and would make them way too powerful.'
15:04:10: You chat 'Definitely would never even consider hall/confuse/poison.'
15:04:11: Ranak chats 'honestly, curse should be gone'
15:04:27: You chat 'What sucks about skills like curse and hallucinate'
15:04:32: Ranak chats 'that would solve the problem of people pragging and cursing'
15:04:35: You chat 'Is that creates of certain mobs, for example, Vaz.'
15:04:41: You chat 'Curse was intended to be the primary tactic by Brian'
15:05:20: You chat 'I feel mobs would need to be updated, or at least checked in on, to make sure they'll even get done at that point.'
15:05:30: Ranak chats 'absolutely'
15:05:30: You chat 'Without updating them, after a curse power change.'
15:05:43: You chat 'Hallucinate and confuse don't really belong in PK, IMO'
15:05:54: You chat 'Confuse I know has been around for ages, as a level 3 power that everyone used.'
15:06:03: You chat 'Those were the days, btw. :P'
15:06:17: Ranak chats 'hahahaha confuse battles'
15:06:19: You chat 'But getting rid of those powers is near impossible, because all smobs are based around them.'
15:06:33: Ranak chats 'hallucinate needs to be redone, dave has had some good ideas on that'
15:06:35: Ranak chats 'don't like hal in pk'
15:06:39: Ranak chats 'but i DO like confuse in pk'
15:06:52: Ranak chats 'confuse isn't a guaranteed hit AND it takes a lot to get it off'
15:06:53: You chat 'When I PK against Glenn.... :P'
15:07:01: Neurosis chats 'sup'
15:07:02: You chat 'When he leads with a hallucinate, or confuses me'
15:07:05: You chat 'I fear his mounts. :O'
15:07:10: Ranak chats 'hahahahaha nice'
15:07:15: Ranak chats 'hi neuro'
15:07:16: You chat 'Howdy Neuro'
15:07:19: Ranak chats 'i just run when confused'
15:07:28: Neurosis chats 'what you cool cats up to'
15:07:30: Ranak chats 'the smartest time to confuse is when they're wounded'
15:07:33: Ranak chats 'X to the P'
15:07:38: You chat 'Yeah, I don't like PKing when someone is using those powers.  The only time I ever consider them is when they're used on me.'
15:07:51: You chat 'Personally, I prefer haze.'
15:07:58: You chat 'But the damn spell never lands.'
15:08:16: You chat 'If only relocate/ID had the same chance of hazing you as the power itself.'
15:08:27: Ranak chats 'HAHAHA oh baham i like that'
15:09:11: You chat 'Btw, good thing I tested that stuff for bugs.'
15:09:16: You chat 'Found 3-4 right off the bat. >.>'
15:09:22: Ranak chats 'HAHAHA nice'
15:12:16: Vengeance chats 'hello'
15:12:22: Ranak chats 'a hoi hoi!'
15:12:22: You chat 'Holy hell'
15:12:25: Ranak chats '4 lhuths =)'
15:12:34: Vengeance chats 'indeed :-)'
15:13:17: You chat 'The entire PBase is on lhuth.  That's ironic. :P'
15:13:26: Ranak chats 'i blame lee and kenny'
15:13:38: You chat 'Those assholes.'
15:14:14: You tell Ranak 'So you said 13m is when you headed to Nettles?'
15:14:20: Ranak tells you 'bout there yeah'
15:14:26: You tell Ranak 'All goblins and bears?'
15:14:29: Ranak tells you '12-13'
15:14:35: Ranak tells you 'gobbos first, then bears'
15:15:15: You tell Ranak 'Word!  All leach?'
15:15:34: Neurosis chats 'shit'
15:15:38: You chat '?'
15:16:00: Neurosis chats 'just throwing it into the conversation :)'
15:16:24: You chat 'Ahh good call!'
15:16:29: You chat 'I never saw it that way.'
15:20:52: Ranak tells you 'ummmmmm, yeah i think leach at that level'
15:20:56: Ranak tells you 'let me look at my sheet'
15:21:15: You tell Ranak 'Lol it's all good really.  I'm sure I'll figure it out.'
15:22:33: Neurosis chats 'so whats up'
15:22:39: Neurosis chats 'anything'
15:22:59: You chat 'Just getting some XPing done.  Wanted a more survivable lhuth with better stats.'
15:23:06: You chat 'A modern one, where stat hikes work better. :P'
15:23:13: Neurosis chats 'haha'
15:23:20: Neurosis chats 'whats max stat sum for lhuth?'
15:23:27: You chat '94.'
15:23:41: Neurosis chats 'holy hell'
15:23:59: Neurosis chats 'i got room for 9 more hikes'
15:24:05: Ranak tells you 'depending on the mob level leach or dark bolt'
15:24:06: You chat 'Yeah, ditto.'
15:24:13: Ranak tells you 'if it's higher go leach, if it's lower to bolt'
15:24:30: You tell Ranak 'Ahh word.  Do you have mob levels? :P'
15:24:37: Ranak tells you 'nope, just by 'con''
15:24:39: You tell Ranak 'As far as goblins go anyways, they're the lowest right?'
15:26:41: You tell Ranak 'Hmm.  Do you go full armor? :O'
15:27:55: Ranak tells you 'nope, although i cast flee the bears'
15:27:57: Ranak tells you 'not prep flee'
15:27:59: Ranak tells you 'cast flee'
15:28:06: You tell Ranak '*nod* That's what I have to do with Goblin'
15:28:09: You tell Ranak 'He's fucking me up too fast. :O'
15:31:06: Ranak tells you 'i cast flee the gobbo warriors, everyone else is okay i think.  of course i'm 15w 12m at legend too...'
15:31:25: You tell Ranak 'Ahh it was the warrior I struggled with'
15:47:31: You tell Ranak 'Damn these bears are awesome.'
15:47:38: Ranak tells you 'yeah!'
15:47:41: You tell Ranak '5 dark bolts == 2.8k'
15:47:43: Ranak tells you 'you see how i leveled so fast'
15:48:03: You tell Ranak 'Yeah, I'm not so jealous now. :P'
15:49:17: Eek chats 'welp. I deserve that'
15:49:27: Ranak chats 'what's that?'
15:49:36: Eek chats 'hehe, died to magus'
15:49:46: Ranak chats 'hahaha whoops'
16:03:07: You chat 'Hah'
16:03:16: You chat 'Take that Ranak'

16:16:50: Neurosis chats 'so....'
16:17:13: Vengeance chats 'someone has plant grouped'
16:17:18: Vengeance chats 'want me to kill it?'
16:17:31: Neurosis chats 'i haven't played lhuth in so long, and i never went in old caves, how do i get in there'
16:17:38: Neurosis chats 'old caves/current caves'
16:17:54: Vengeance chats 'SW of dfr a bit'
16:18:05: Neurosis chats 'i'm at karvok'
16:19:40: Vengeance chats 'i pulled lever for you '
16:26:43: Neurosis chats 'so is there any other lhuth rents other than magus and kurn'
16:27:05: Vengeance chats 'I'm not sure'
16:28:01: Vengeance chats 'muzgash is lhuth safe I believe, but not sure if you can rent there'
16:28:29: Neurosis chats 'i think fungal is friendly too but not a rent'
16:29:12: Vengeance chats 'where is kurn again?'
16:29:20: Neurosis chats 'main level dg'
16:29:36: Vengeance chats 'are dg mobs not aggy towards lhuths?'
16:30:01: Neurosis chats 'they are but kurn is not, so orc guards will swing at you and shit but you can rent at kurn if you can get there without anger'
16:30:13: Vengeance chats 'ah cool'
16:30:30: Neurosis chats 'where i just came from actually haha, figured i needed to check out magus'
16:30:47: Ranak chats 'i thought they changed kurn'
16:31:06: Ranak chats 'i wouldn't rent there again though, since when new races come in none of dg will be friendly to lhuths'
16:31:08: Neurosis chats 'to aggy for lhuth?'
16:31:23: Ranak chats 'yeah thought theuy changed kurn being rentable a while ago'
16:31:25: Ranak chats 'but i could be wrong'
16:31:50: Neurosis chats 'they haven't yet, i just came from there and when i logged earlier and walked around some i went and rented back there'
16:32:01: Ranak chats 'weird'
16:32:12: Ranak chats 'i don't recommend renting there again =P'
16:32:27: Ranak chats 'might be a deadly log in when the new races are imped lol'
16:33:33: Neurosis chats 'nod'
