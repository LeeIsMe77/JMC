08:21:13: You chat 'Howdy.'
14:23:26: Lowtheim chats 'hi wabba!'
14:23:30: You chat 'Howdy!'
14:23:57: You chat 'How are you today?'
14:24:10: Lowtheim chats 'good!  pounding out work'
14:24:22: You chat 'Doesn't sound terribly fun. :O'
14:24:26: Lowtheim chats 'it's not really'
14:25:19: You chat ':P Kenny and I are preparing to create an army of lhuths.'
14:25:26: Lowtheim chats 'good god.'
14:25:28: You chat 'Seeing what kind of gear we had to work with. :P'
14:25:28: Lowtheim chats 'do that'
14:26:02: You chat 'Were going to last night, but decided I had to kick his ass in hockey'
14:26:09: Lowtheim chats 'nice =)'
14:26:10: You chat 'He ended up beating me 12-1 in one game. :|'
14:26:31: Lowtheim chats 'i have a....30w lhuth that's level 22 that i just can't by myself lol'
14:26:41: You chat 'Lol'
14:26:48: You chat 'Well you may need to join our army then. :O'
14:27:00: Lowtheim chats 'you had me at 'lhuth army''
14:27:04: You chat 'This guy is a 35m and kind of mediocre stat wise.'
14:27:11: Lowtheim chats 'stats don't really matter for lhuths'
14:27:12: You chat 'Was too much of a pain to finish XPing him back in the day.'
14:27:22: You chat 'Meh, intelligence matters!'
14:27:40: You chat 'Every 5 intelligence is 1 additional number an enemy needs to roll on a 6 sided die.'
14:27:45: You chat 'To determine if you're resisted.'
14:28:23: You chat 'Er, I think it was 5.  Might be 6.'
14:28:23: Lowtheim chats 'now you got me thinking, karvok isn't coming back, nicci is 36m with 18 int, irma is 30m 20t 19 int'
14:28:27: Lowtheim chats 'it's 5'
14:28:48: Lowtheim chats 'i really should make a 30m 15w 12r 9t'
14:28:53: Lowtheim chats 'that's the 'best' combo really'
14:28:56: You chat 'Will plays in to that as well, though I'm questioning how much I really want to go higher will over higher HP.'
14:29:17: You chat 'Needless to say, my first lhuth in ages will most certainly be a huge mage with low HP, like this one.'
14:29:24: Lowtheim chats 'Class levels: Mag:30 Cle:20 Ran:4 War:5, irma'
14:29:31: Lowtheim chats 'her resist poison is FAST'
14:29:43: You chat 'Oh no shit?'
14:29:52: You chat 'I never even considered the casting time on resist.'
14:29:56: You chat 'only whether or not I obtained it.'
14:30:08: Lowtheim chats 'not cast time, but how long it takes to rem the poison'
14:30:09: You chat 'On top of that, I imagine the higher the mystic level, the quicker it dispels the poison.'
14:30:12: You chat 'Ahh.'
14:30:15: Lowtheim chats 'yeah'
14:30:25: You chat 'Think that I'm interested in though'
14:30:31: You chat 'Is poison chances on black arrow vs mage level.'
14:31:30: You chat 'Kinda stinks that whities are on.  I'd consider idle XPing but I'm sure I'll get found and killed. :P'
14:31:48: You chat 'Especially if it's Storm.  PKed against him the other day with Kenny... dude is a beast.'
14:32:08: You chat 'He killed Kuran, and then continued to get both of us awful/bloodied before we finally got him.'
14:32:12: Lowtheim chats 'lol and remember lowbie protection is only L10 or 1/3 your level if it's lower'
14:32:32: You chat 'Yeah, that's even more scary. :P'
14:32:45: You chat 'Hah.  Apparently I had high expectations back in the day.  I'm teleport spec.'
14:32:51: Lowtheim chats 'LOL!'
14:32:52: You chat 'Then again, dark spec didn't exist.'
14:33:16: Lowtheim chats 'yeah all mine are teleport or wild'
14:33:32: You chat 'Kind of interesting how spec changes will impact lhuths now, compared to the past.'
14:33:45: You chat 'Dark spec, heavy fighting, etc, could all be beneficial.'
14:33:49: You chat 'Or even protection.'
14:34:13: Lowtheim chats 'i never thought about heavy spec'
14:34:20: Lowtheim chats 'dark spec makes spear a nasty bitch'
14:34:32: You chat 'So I talked to Dave about armor specs the other day.'
14:34:43: You chat 'Because frankly, heavy spec is AMAZING.'
14:34:59: You chat 'But I was thinking about mages and how I'd like to see 2 things.'
14:35:18: Lowtheim chats 'what 2 things'
14:35:23: You chat 'A) Weapons and armor aimed at casters in general, which do not increase skill encumbrance'
14:35:45: You chat 'B) A light armor spec that helps negate skill encumbrance on casters.'
14:36:05: You chat 'Making it ideal for casters with no strength who can't carry metal, but die very quickly.'
14:36:15: You chat 'At least their spells would land more often. :P'
14:36:27: Lowtheim chats 'i like the idea of low encumb stuff for mages, the tough part is balancing around warriors who could wreck shit with it'
14:36:42: You chat 'That's the wonderous thing about it.'
14:36:51: You chat 'If it's low skill encumber and aimed at casters, go -20OB. :P'
14:36:59: Lowtheim chats 'well mr smarty man'
14:37:02: You chat 'Or even - strength stat.'
14:37:03: Lowtheim chats 'that's a fuckin good idea'
14:37:26: Lowtheim chats 'let me get it on my 'gear idea's sheet'
14:37:48: You chat 'For someone who craves being able to cast spells, hitting is the last thing on their list of things to do successfully.'
14:38:32: You chat 'And even more interesting, it'd be a new set of gear-items which aren't focused on the obviously desired +MR +WP'
14:39:03: Lowtheim chats 'dammit you're speaking my language, you know i love meaningful choices...'
14:39:33: You chat 'And the weigh-off... do I want to land more spells, or be able to heal mana faster after losing concentration and costing myself extra mana? :P'
14:44:08: You chat 'Heh.  Gotta disable food triggers I guess.  4 pieces of flesh don't go far. :P'
14:44:16: Lowtheim chats 'LOL!'
14:44:56: Lowtheim chats 'you reminded me, i've been meaning to have 2-3 pieces of human flesh load in that blink only room s of caves'
14:45:13: You chat 'No idea where that room is. :O'
14:45:30: You chat 'Though I'm more interested on what's going to happen to this side if it acquires a new race. :o'
14:45:52: Lowtheim chats 'it's classic lhuth!  there's a hidden door down like all s e s w s s s s ish of the snake'
14:46:34: Lowtheim chats 'xping will be slightly easier, since harads could actually buff something'
14:46:43: You chat 'My ability to navigate this map has slipped since drugs were a part of my life. :)'
14:46:50: Lowtheim chats 'lol'
14:47:00: You chat 'Quitting them does not bring back memory, apparently.'
14:47:11: Lowtheim chats 'woof!'
14:55:28: You chat 'Oh I love when code works as expected.'
14:55:42: Lowtheim chats 'hahahaha did you just do something cool?'
14:55:55: Orome says 'boo'
14:56:01: You chat 'Cool, no. :P  Some bullshit winforms stuff for work.'
14:56:09: Lowtheim chats 'oh lol'
14:56:19: You chat 'I've been having troubles coming up with some cool scripts to write!'
16:00:14: You say 'open'
16:10:22: You say 'open'
16:12:15: Lowtheim chats 'dark bolt is i think the way to go for damage, i don't think you're quite high enough to lock it up with agony yet?'
16:12:23: You chat 'Yeah, I'm not. :P'
16:13:06: You chat 'Ugh, I really need to get my aliases fixed.'
16:14:25: You chat 'Actually, I think now is a good time to pracreset off of teleportation. :|'
16:14:35: You tell Guardian angel 'pracreset'
16:14:37: Lowtheim chats 'YES!  get dat dark'
16:15:22: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:24: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:25: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:27: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:28: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:30: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:31: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:33: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:34: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:36: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:40: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:40: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:40: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:41: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:41: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:15:41: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:16:00: You chat 'Ooh, I have a request for maga. :P'
16:16:19: You chat 'So when you cast spells like agony... you need to type: cast 'word of agony''
16:16:44: You chat 'But when you practice, you can't use single quotes.'
16:17:06: Magus tells you 'I know nothing about it.'
16:19:13: Lowtheim tells you 'pretty consistent 45 damage'
16:19:16: You tell Lowtheim ':D'
16:19:23: Lowtheim tells you 'yeah that's legit'
16:19:32: You tell Lowtheim 'Not bad for a 25m'
16:19:43: Lowtheim tells you 'not at all!  spec helps so much'
16:19:54: You tell Lowtheim 'Lhuths kind of have the best of both sides.'
16:20:07: Lowtheim tells you 'how's that?'
16:20:07: You tell Lowtheim 'Chill kinda got a nuke from some aspects being made cold spec'
16:20:15: You tell Lowtheim 'Lhuths get the full benefit from all spells in 1 spec.'
16:20:28: You tell Lowtheim 'It really kind of makes them a lot more powerful than any other mage.'
16:20:35: Lowtheim tells you 'HAHAHAHAHA yes that is the advantage of extremely limited skills'
16:20:50: You tell Lowtheim 'Even their locking skill word of agony... dark spec works.'
16:21:08: You tell Lowtheim 'It should be interesting.  I'd bet smobbing on lhuth would be easier than uruk hai'
16:21:08: Lowtheim tells you 'i don't believe dark increases agony'
16:21:20: You tell Lowtheim 'Might not help the stun... but I'm sure it helps damage.'
16:21:35: Lowtheim tells you 'ask maga, but i'm like 99% sure it doesn't'
16:21:38: Lowtheim tells you 'i could de fbe wrong'
16:21:40: You tell Lowtheim 'Oh. :('
16:23:47: You tell Lowtheim 'Interesting how black arrow works.'
16:24:05: Lowtheim tells you 'i think it was simpler before, but the amount of double kills from the poison made them change it'
16:24:17: You tell Lowtheim 'Ah interesting.'
16:25:02: You tell Lowtheim 'Before, it was literally "If it's resisted, it won't poison.  If not, then it's part of a randomizer. :P'
16:27:11: Maga chats 'So Wabbafet when casting it needs single quotes because cast has a third argument it takes'
16:27:38: Maga chats 'prac only takes a single argument so no need for quotes'
16:27:42: You chat 'Yeah, I get that.  I just always try to use them for pracresets, and it ends up failing after running a #5 {prac everySingleSkillICan}'
16:28:12: Maga chats 'lol Yep me too'
16:28:19: You chat 'Not a huge deal or anything.  Just a pain when I realize I made a mistake. :p'
16:28:31: Maga chats 'I can look into allowing single quotes in the prac command'
16:29:01: You chat 'I understand that adding delimiters when not expected can cause chaos.'
16:38:21: Lowtheim says 'no breeders?'
16:38:25: Lowtheim says 'you need food?'
16:38:27: You say 'Testing the waters first. :P'
16:38:34: You say 'Meh. I'm low, but not out.'
16:38:43: Lowtheim says 'on lancet'
16:38:44: Lowtheim says 'lol'
16:38:54: Lowtheim says 'was gonna go say go kill the doorguard at muzgash'
16:38:58: Lowtheim says 'he's got a knife'
16:39:01: Lowtheim says 'but you got a lancet'
16:39:05: You say 'Yeah, somehow I obtained this.'
16:39:11: You say 'I believe it was from a whitie-raid of caves in 2008.'
16:39:14: You say 'You know how those turn out.'
16:39:30: Lowtheim says 'and how =P'
16:43:10: You chat 'Doh.  Helps to remove etched when fighting small mobs. >.>'
18:34:22: You say 'open'
