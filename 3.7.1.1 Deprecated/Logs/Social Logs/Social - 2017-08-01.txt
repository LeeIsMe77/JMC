17:34:09: You chat 'They're expecting a final product that's set and ready to go.  I write the code, but it gets set up by integrations'
17:34:19: You chat 'So they data I send may be incorrect, but the integrity of the code is what I test.'
17:34:32: Lowtheim chats 'seems logical'
17:34:52: You chat 'So their IT guy told me "Hey, STOP uploading the same stuff.  Can you PLEASE upload something up to date?"'
17:35:08: You chat 'I blew up, to a certain degree, because the data in their source system from which I was extracting...'
17:35:26: You chat 'I was only doing a specific data range, because the rest of the data they intentionally broke to test the validation of my software.'
17:35:46: You chat 'So nothing was succeeding because it was bad data, so they'd never get it if they wanted it, otherwise my product wouldn't meet standards.'
17:35:55: Lowtheim chats 'that all makes sense'
17:35:59: You chat 'Oooh boy.  Sorry, I'm on a rant today.  It's been a fucked up week. :P'

17:36:38: Lowtheim chats 'he's got a reputation'
17:36:41: You chat 'Plus, they give me sizes for all data going in, which matches the field lengths on their tables in their database.'
17:36:44: Lowtheim chats 'for requesting shit and not using it'
17:36:46: You chat 'You can continue. :P'
17:37:08: Lowtheim chats 'and today i find out, he wants a custom workspace built in the ticketing software we use'
17:37:16: Lowtheim chats 'and i'm the only one that does that'
17:37:22: Lowtheim chats 'so he kind of spitballs what he wants'
17:37:46: Lowtheim chats 'and i'm looking at .....20 or so hours to do it and include all the rules he wants and make it look pretty'
17:37:49: Lowtheim chats 'which isn't much'
17:37:57: Lowtheim chats 'but consider that that's something that i do EXTRA'
17:38:21: Lowtheim chats 'i'd be stepping away from my normal duties to spend half a week building this for him'
17:38:31: Lowtheim chats 'so i tell him to spec it out for me'
17:38:40: You chat 'Does he work with your company, or is he a client/third party?'
17:38:41: Lowtheim chats 'i'm like, i need details'
17:38:46: Lowtheim chats 'within the company'
17:39:05: Lowtheim chats 'so i finally got it through his thick skull that it's going to take at LEAST 4 hours of his time to spec it out for me'
17:39:10: Lowtheim chats 'and all of a sudden he's not that interseted'
17:39:13: Lowtheim chats 'fucking prick'
17:39:18: You chat 'Lmao'
17:39:31: You chat 'As soon as you put any effort whatsoever on their end, they drop it.  I hate those people.'
17:39:45: Lowtheim chats 'he's willing to make me work on it, but when i need him i need anything he doesn't want to do it'
17:39:50: Lowtheim chats 'yeah it's not HIS time that's getting wasted'
17:40:02: Lowtheim chats 'and this is complicated enough that i take of my 'interpreter' hat to do it'
17:40:17: Lowtheim chats 'i can't interpret what they want, i need actual hard specifications'
17:40:30: You chat 'Hah, yes.'
17:40:56: Lowtheim chats 'keep in mind this is after i spent a half hour digging through the system to free up licenses for his guys'
17:41:04: Lowtheim chats 'then he was like well maybe i want more people to do it'
17:41:13: You chat 'That's exactly what I just got done telling this client.  "I don't guess.  If you give me specifications, and your specifications don't make sense or are not right, I will follow your specifications, and ask you if I deem it necessary."'
17:41:14: Lowtheim chats 'and i'm like well we'd need more licenses which are expensive'
17:41:27: Lowtheim chats 'and he didn't want to buy licenses'
17:41:37: Lowtheim chats 'until i told him they were charged to the company as a whole and not his area'
17:41:42: Lowtheim chats 'then he's like 'fuck yeah buy em all''
17:41:47: You chat 'Hahahaha'
17:42:13: Lowtheim chats 'but i generally don't work with direct specifications, so i can imagine it gets frustrating when people give you specs and then don't like the result'
17:42:22: Lowtheim chats 'like garbage in garbage out idiot'
17:43:10: You chat 'This same client on my end... they gave me field lengths for their database... and their address field is 35 characters.  That's ridiculously small.'
17:43:35: You chat 'But shit, you didn't tell me A) they you were splitting that into 5 fields in a script before it goes into the table, and you didn't tell me what your script is looking for in terms of length.'
17:44:02: You chat 'But you email me every 3 hours asking for my status and rushing me to get it done.'
17:44:15: You chat 'And then bitch when it's not right by YOUR standards, and not those which you supply me with.'
17:44:58: You chat 'And this Jesse Fucking Miller guy.... he sounds like a piece of work. :P'
17:45:12: Lowtheim chats 'lol he is'
17:45:28: Lowtheim chats 'and you've been working with this customer for a while now'

17:49:56: You chat 'And I'm pretty sure he casts.'

17:50:46: Lowtheim chats 'yeah i tried to pick mobs that didn't have a lot of other shit going on with them'
17:50:53: You chat 'Lazora woulda been cool, but it's hard with once-a-day mobs, especially if they load best in-slot gear.'
17:51:34: You chat 'I do like, actually, how you made mobs like Naurig load them.'
17:51:50: You chat 'I think it's a good way to encourage people to kill other smobs which don't get killed often.'

17:55:30: Lowtheim chats 'which is something that definitely needs to be addressed'

22:59:05: Vagor group-says 'by the time the eunuchs s are dead the eunuchs here will be back'
22:59:07: Cull group-says 'i think the best plan is if we go in and nuke 1. while diabolos spams on 2.'
22:59:09: Vagor group-says 'prob take 2-3 rounds just to kill them :P'
22:59:18: Cull group-says 'sincy myrium rescues anyway'

23:05:04: Vagor group-says 'less than 1. you have a bunch of nonsense in your window'
23:05:30: You group-say 'Yeah, but it was technically 3 scroll ups'
23:05:36: You group-say 'But 1 scrollup is 1/3 of a scren'

23:07:20: Vagor says 'lol'
23:07:28: Cull says 'i'm going to set them both to right before the script kick off'
23:07:33: Cull says 'i'd like to see if we can replicate'
23:07:39: Vagor says 'fair enough'
23:07:49: Cull says 'since getting both scripts to fire within X seconds (i'll not tell) is a win condition'
23:07:58: Cull says 'so technically, you won already'
23:08:01: Vagor says 'so same plan, diabs hit 2.'
23:08:22: Vagor says 'if 1. is healed first, flee and hit 2.'
23:08:25: Vagor says 'and vice versa'
23:08:33: Vagor says 'ready?'
23:08:36: You say '2. is Myriam?'

23:10:20: Vagor says 'on accident?'
23:10:33: Cull says 'it was done 100% correct'
23:10:42: Cull says 'i need to look into why it didn't work'
23:10:54: Cull says 'as i said before, getting both scripts to fire within X seconds is the win condition'
23:11:03: Cull says 'and the bug didn't repeat itself'
23:11:31: Vagor says 'well, good stuff'
23:11:33: Vagor says 'we won'
23:11:35: You say 'Odd.'

23:15:34: Radga says 'did boots get fixed yet'
23:15:40: Vagor says 'same as shiny black boots i believe'
