10:13:23: You chat 'Derp.'
10:13:27: Lortheim chats 'hi bacon'
10:13:33: Tantrum chats 'i love bacon'
10:13:36: You chat 'Common typo. :P'
10:14:08: You chat 'I love those days when the boss calls you and says "I'm just calling to tell you I won't be able to talk to you today.  Have a good weekend, keep busy."'
10:14:43: Mugen chats 'lol'
10:15:19: Tantrum chats 'yeah.. it's like i'm going home after lunch kinda day when that happens.'
10:15:22: Mugen chats 'i was reading that and expected it to go..."I'm just calling to tell you...I love you"'
10:15:33: You chat ':S'
10:15:53: You chat 'I would go home after lunch, but I'm already home.'
10:16:22: You chat 'It's more like one of those "I'll take a nap at noon and open a beer at 1" kinda days.'
10:16:32: Tantrum chats 'lol'
10:16:47: Tantrum chats 'i need to buy a str hike'
10:17:15: Mugen tells you 'so got it storing all offensive spells now'
10:17:35: You tell Mugen 'You, sir, did well!  Guessing you aren't even trying to guess damage. :P'
10:17:37: Mugen tells you 'Lortheim: Avg (4.65), DPS (0.63), hallucinate (5), poison (2), chill ray (33), firebolt (4)''
10:18:12: You tell Mugen 'It is kind of interesting though, as spells do have base ranges.'
10:18:21: You tell Mugen 'But spells like firebolt are 1-120 kinda deal.'
10:18:32: Mugen tells you 'yeah, which i find really weird'
10:18:46: Mugen tells you 'fire is meant to be a farely stable high damage spell'
10:18:52: Mugen tells you 'lightning spells have the big ranges'
10:19:08: Mugen tells you 'in all dndesque magic systems, thats the way it goes'
10:19:58: Mugen tells you 'i mean, i could arbitrarily give the spells a damage value'
10:20:05: Mugen tells you 'but it wouldn't mean shit'
10:20:23: Mugen tells you 'at least arrows use the normal hitting range convention'
10:23:54: Lortheim chats 'sounds rough baiken'
10:25:48: You tell Mugen 'Yeah, well thing with fire'
10:25:58: You tell Mugen 'Fireball is supposed to be the stable spell, but it's unusable because of splash damage.'
10:26:05: You tell Mugen 'So splash damage is, at the least, being removed for fire spec.'
10:26:22: Maga chats 'Good morning :)'
10:26:25: You tell Mugen 'Which really should have happened when the changes first went live, because now fire in general is just not usable at all. :P'
10:26:26: Lortheim chats 'MAGA!'
10:26:28: Mugen chats 'morning'
10:26:30: Lortheim chats 'what's up my man'
10:26:31: You chat 'Top of the mornin' to you.'
10:27:00: Mugen chats 'fyi, there is a lot of important ppl on atm :p'
10:27:10: Lortheim chats 'yeah lee and neil'
10:27:10: Maga chats 'Just enjoying my last day of vacation with a shit ton of whiskey in my coffee :p'
10:27:12: Mugen chats 'the intelligence is rising'
10:27:21: Mugen chats 'oh hell yeah'
10:27:27: Mugen chats 'why even bother with the coffee'
10:27:33: Lortheim chats 'VACATION!  you butt, you never told me you were on vaca!  you go anywhere?'
10:27:42: Maga chats 'So I don't judge myself :p'
10:27:47: You chat 'I'm quite unimportant and unintelligent. :P'
10:28:01: Mugen chats 'lol, denial is a bitch'
10:28:03: You chat 'But I will agree with Maga, alcohol causes the perception of intelligence to rise significantly.'
10:28:07: Maga chats 'Nope, just did job interviews all week'
10:28:09: You chat 'It's called the Balmer Curve'
10:28:29: Mugen chats 'explain to me how that was a vacation then...'
10:28:38: You chat 'https://xkcd.com/323/'
10:29:04: Lortheim chats 'that's a good one bacon'
10:29:15: Mugen chats 'lee, your next char should be called regex'
10:29:25: You chat 'Oh god no.'
10:29:28: Mugen chats ':p'
10:29:45: Mugen chats 'ive got a shit load now :s'
10:29:54: Mugen chats 'seems stable enough though'
10:30:04: Mugen chats 'seems to clip everything well enough'
10:42:01: Mugen chats 'i only ever fart around on here'
10:42:11: Mugen chats 'many fartings'
10:42:13: Lortheim chats 'good for your intestines'
10:43:27: You chat 'Wtf'
10:43:35: You chat 'Just came back from a call to see you guys talking about farting. :S'
10:43:47: Mugen chats 'lol'
10:44:02: Mugen chats 'well, matt keeps feeing me cabbage'
10:44:03: You chat 'Oh, I guess context helps.'
10:44:35: You chat 'So I finally got Vaz to drop a dragon shield for Diabolos last night.'
10:44:43: Lortheim chats 'yay!'
10:44:44: You chat 'Took my dragon's eyes I've stocked up on to Karugh.'
10:44:55: You chat 'And turns out I couldn't carry a 10lb bladder for the trade-in.'
10:45:00: Lortheim chats 'doh'
10:45:24: You chat 'My works VPN lost internet connection while doing Vaz, and I was using their gateway for my internet at the time.'
10:45:49: You chat 'So I dropped link with statue on me, and fortunately had the idea to drop the VPN and try reconnecting, and came back 10 seconds later bloodied. :P'
10:46:30: Lortheim chats 'WHAT?!?'
10:46:32: You chat 'And then somehow unknown to me, my 31T has now successfully butchered 4 consecutive marble daggers with a marble dagger.'
10:46:32: Lortheim chats 'damn'
10:46:40: Lortheim chats 'hahahahahahahaha'
10:46:43: Lortheim chats 'you lived?'
10:46:46: You chat 'Yeah. :P'
10:46:53: You chat 'Fast thinking.  I was lucky, and wimpy.'
10:47:51: Mugen chats 'what coeffs would you make for a smob buffer?'
10:48:09: Lortheim chats '30w 15r 9t 12m is always solid'
10:48:11: Mugen chats 'my human just doesn't have any hps :('
10:48:21: Mugen chats 'would have to be dwarf though'
10:48:22: Lortheim chats 'cure selves'
10:48:29: You chat 'I honestly prefer this guy as a smob buffer. :O  But Lor is right.'
10:48:35: You chat 'And really, I prefer humans over dwarves.'
10:48:42: Mugen chats 'i hate making dwarves'
10:48:43: Lortheim chats 'problem is stats'
10:48:46: You chat 'Healing capabilities supercede super-HP.'
10:48:47: Mugen chats 'but hps matter'
10:49:00: Lortheim chats 'to get a 19 con max, you're looking at 19 str 19dex 19 con'
10:49:00: You chat 'And the higher perception without a circlet, means you get more mid-fight healing without removing armor.'
10:49:27: Mugen chats 'you wouldn't miss the riposte?'
10:49:37: Mugen chats 'i mean, you aren't really using it for damage i guess'
10:49:50: Mugen chats 'but i feel like this 27w,21r is pretty lacklustre'
10:49:57: You chat 'The only things I riposte are not-so-large smobs when they're first confused (baz, luna, great goblin, etc)'
10:50:08: You chat 'Of course, I have riposte Pale before as well. :P'
10:50:31: Lortheim chats 'i figure for 'smobbing' you're getting hit every turn, so you need to look at hit points and damage mitigation'
10:50:40: Lortheim chats 'and healing i guess'
10:50:46: You chat 'What I think would be interesting is going, say, 15 mage'
10:50:50: You chat 'And trying protection spec.'
10:50:55: Lortheim chats 'which are all what they call in WoW, 'Effective Hit Points''
10:50:58: You chat 'I'd love to see how a 15M shield spell is with protection.'
10:51:00: Mugen chats 'eh, guess i need to make a dwa war then :s'
10:51:09: Lortheim chats 'hmmmm'
10:51:17: Lortheim chats 'if you're doing that...30w 18m?'
10:51:36: You chat 'It's still plausible hitting 500+ hps on an 18m dwarf'
10:51:38: You chat 'So why not?'
10:51:39: Mugen chats 'would the loss in hp be worth the stronger shield'
10:51:57: Lortheim chats 'i have a 30w 20m dwarf'
10:52:02: You chat 'I'd say so for a good reason.'
10:52:03: Lortheim chats 'i forget his hit points'
10:52:12: You chat 'The first 10 seconds of a round are the most crucial'
10:52:23: You chat 'And a lot of times, how long the round lasts depends on whether the mystic lands it's spells fast.'
10:52:32: You chat 'Negating damage in those first 10 seconds buys time for the mystic to do its job.'
10:52:42: Lortheim chats 'oof'
10:52:55: Lortheim chats 'my 30w 20m has 325 hit points =|'
10:53:01: You chat 'Lol.'
10:53:01: Lortheim chats 'with 20 con'
10:53:06: Mugen chats 'i mean, i like my 30w,21r, but shitty con and no m is a minus'
10:53:15: You chat 'You could always do a Baiken. :P'
10:53:22: Mugen chats 'which is'
10:53:32: You chat '27r 23w'
10:53:34: You chat '498 hps'
10:53:35: Mugen chats 'stats?'
10:53:39: You chat 'Str: 20/20, Int: 14/14, Wil: 11/11, Dex: 21/21, Con: 21/21, Lea: 13/13.'
10:53:40: Mugen chats 'statsum: 100'
10:53:51: Lortheim chats 'breddy good!'
10:54:04: Mugen chats 'what are the other coeffs?'
10:54:09: You chat '9m 3t'
10:54:20: Lortheim chats 'i think going defender spec is key for smobbin tho'
10:54:32: You chat 'THe fortunate part is it's very easy to hit 100% perception and 0% perception with a mystic, without anything except a silver chain.'
10:54:36: Mugen chats 'when i was using it, it didn't proc enough to matter though'
10:55:12: Mugen chats 'it hardly ever procced when fighting normal stuff cuz defsum was high enough'
10:55:39: Lortheim chats 'i have luck going berserk with metal and dragon shield, get a lot of benefit from it on regular mobs that way =P'
10:56:27: Mugen chats 'you got lucky with your con hikes B :('
10:56:32: Mugen chats 'i wanted this guy to get con'
10:56:36: Mugen chats 'but matt jinxed me'
10:56:38: Mugen chats 'again'
10:56:47: Mugen chats 'Str: 21/21, Int: 15/15, Wil:  8/ 8, Dex: 20/20, Con: 17/17, Lea: 11/11.'
10:56:48: Mugen chats 'statsum: 92'
10:58:19: Mugen chats 'i think 27r,20w,8t,12m is great coeffs'
10:58:29: Mugen chats 'get a decent tame'
10:59:34: Mugen chats 'hmm, not even sure i got a 27r,20w on puke'
11:00:03: Mugen chats 'is it possible to find char names i might have lost?'
11:00:14: Mugen chats 'i feel like im missing a few'
11:00:39: Lortheim chats 'yeah'
11:00:50: Lortheim chats 'it's not always easy'
11:00:54: Lortheim chats 'but we can usually find shit'
11:01:03: Mugen chats 'i presume im the only person playing in aus'
11:01:15: Mugen chats 'if that narrows it down'
11:01:15: Lortheim chats 'hahaha i'd think so'
11:01:25: Mugen chats 'captor may log every now and then'
11:01:38: Mugen chats 'or not'
11:01:39: Lortheim chats 'captor is an auzzie?'
11:01:40: Mugen chats 'lol 2014'
11:01:43: Mugen chats 'correct'
11:01:47: Mugen chats 'Eli is his name'
11:01:50: Lortheim chats 'hah! cool!'
11:02:12: Mugen chats 'avatar is also'
11:02:57: Mugen chats 'vidoq was estonian'
11:03:04: Lortheim chats 'that much i knew'
11:03:10: Lortheim chats 'his name was kristjan'
11:03:19: Mugen chats 'is he in the fb group?'
11:03:27: Lortheim chats 'no =('
11:03:30: Mugen chats 'wonder what he is doing with himself these days'
11:03:39: Mugen chats 'he pretty much beat this game :p'
11:03:40: Lortheim chats 'playing another mud i'd think'
11:03:48: Lortheim chats 'he worked for a newspaper'
11:03:52: Lortheim chats 'so he was on telnet all day'
11:04:33: Mugen chats 'im curious why vidoq (mob) protects loofs...'
11:04:55: Mugen chats 'wait a min, i might be confused'
11:05:08: Mugen chats 'karvok protects loof caves'
11:05:16: Lortheim chats 'vidoq is the new radbug'
11:05:16: Mugen chats 'vidoq is at radbug?'
11:05:21: Mugen chats 'ah yup'
11:05:25: Mugen chats 'that makes more sense'
11:05:41: Mugen chats 'when is jimmys orc gonna protect caves?'
11:05:45: Mugen chats ':p'
11:06:26: Lortheim chats 'good call!'
11:06:36: Mugen chats 'oh, i do have a 27r,20w'
11:06:53: Mugen chats 'doh, i made him 21w,27r'
11:08:37: Mugen chats 'hmm, wonder if 24/24 would work'
11:10:32: You chat 'I have a 24/24 dwarf.'
11:10:42: You chat 'He is the worst character I've ever made. :P'
11:10:48: Lortheim chats '=O'
11:11:06: You chat 'Str: 21/21, Int: 17/17, Wil:  8/ 8, Dex: 16/16, Con: 21/21, Lea: 12/12.'
11:11:07: Mugen chats 'statsum: 95'
11:11:15: You chat 'You have 334/334 hit, 79/79 stamina, 171/171 moves, 85 spirit.'
11:11:17: Lortheim chats 'that's not terrible'
11:11:27: You chat 'Granted, that IS with stealth.'
11:11:28: Lortheim chats 'not good hit points'
11:11:30: Mugen chats 'thats with full stealth i think'
11:11:34: You chat 'But still, way sub 500.'
11:11:52: You chat 'I was also wrong'
11:11:54: You chat 'He's 25/25'
11:11:56: Mugen chats 'how does hp work'
11:11:59: Mugen chats 'for coeffs'
11:12:39: You chat 'Something along the lines of a +3 bonus for warrior, +2 for ranger, +1 for mystic, and 0 for mage.  That's probably not accurate, but depicts how coeffs effect them.'
11:12:51: Lortheim chats 'yeah that's not the first place i've seen that'
11:13:12: Mugen chats 'and by bonus you mean on top of a normal lvl?'
11:13:14: Lortheim chats 'but it's also not entirely accurate, since 36w seem to get more hits than 35w 10r, which theoreitcally should have more'
11:13:54: You chat 'It's part of a calculation involving hit point constant'
11:14:04: Mugen chats 'and the constant is random?'
11:14:05: You chat 'May even be a multiplier.'
11:14:29: You chat 'Pretty much.  Constant just increase every level, and nearly stops once you hit level 30.'
11:14:37: Mugen chats 'so if i have a char with exact same coeffs, same stats, will the have the same hps?'
11:14:43: You chat 'Nope.'
11:14:51: You chat 'The constant randomly increases.'
11:15:08: Mugen chats 'that seems....shit'
11:15:16: You chat 'Once again, this math is very off, in terms of actual calculation.'
11:15:26: Lortheim chats 'yeah i tried to figure it out to make perfect coefs for highest hp char, and......it doesn't seem to fucking matter'
11:15:28: You chat 'But the concept of how it works is there.'
11:15:34: Lortheim chats 'my 36ws seem to get the best hit points'
11:15:55: You chat 'Warrior Level has the largest impact on HP.'
11:16:10: You chat 'All coeffs impact HP drastically.  That's why HP increases drop at level 30.'
11:16:28: You chat 'Except for mage, which has no real impact on HP.'
11:16:44: Lortheim chats 'yeah there is no 'mage malus' it just doesn't add a bonus'
11:17:00: Mugen chats 'so its more that having m in your coeffs, robs hp gain from levels in other coeffs?'
11:17:03: Lortheim chats 'has anyone ever leveled a 0 0 0 0 to 30?'
11:17:14: Mugen chats 'nope, but i will now'
11:17:28: Lortheim chats 'hahaha he'd need an appropriately drab name'
11:17:33: Lortheim chats 'something real common'
11:17:38: Lortheim chats 'like jed'
11:17:40: Lortheim chats 'or jeb'
11:18:00: Mugen chats 'what race?'
11:18:11: Lortheim chats 'human of course'
11:18:57: Mugen chats 'what stats would i look for on it'
11:19:27: Mugen chats 'or doesn't matter, since really only con should affect hp gain'
11:20:19: Mugen chats 'wow'
11:20:26: Mugen chats '13 con at lvl 30'
11:20:31: Mugen chats '82 hps'
11:21:26: Mugen chats 'i suppose i could quantitatively work it out'
11:21:31: Mugen chats 'but doing lots of trials'
11:24:56: Mugen chats '0,0,0,30 with 14 con got 89'
11:26:44: Mugen chats 'yeah, its wierd'
11:26:59: Mugen chats 'tried 0,0,0,30 again, got 14 con, 82 hps'
11:27:43: Mugen chats 'hike came 5 levels earlier'
11:28:02: Mugen chats 'looks like still a decent amount of variability'
11:29:29: Mugen chats 'thats even weirder'
11:29:36: Mugen chats 'same coeffs'
11:29:45: Mugen chats '95 hps this time'
11:29:49: Mugen chats 'same con'
11:29:54: Mugen chats 'hiked even later'
11:30:03: Mugen chats 'this seems messed up as hell'
11:30:30: Mugen chats 'thats a 13hp swing with no change in coeffs'
11:50:24: Emiya says 'eh, this guy is identical :s'
12:40:28: You chat 'Omg this sub is delicious.'
12:40:32: You chat 'I outdid myself this time.'
12:40:38: Lortheim chats 'not jersey mikes?'
12:40:46: You chat 'Nah.  Homemade.'
12:40:59: You chat 'Turkey, provologne, lots of red hots and a WHOLE lot of black olives.'
12:41:12: You chat 'Lightly toasted to get the cheese to melt'
12:44:58: Jayson chats 'Black chain jerkin load on magus.. Meh, anyone need/want?'
12:45:06: Lortheim says '8 kills on captain and......10+ on naurig'
12:45:38: You say 'Still no cloak?'
12:45:40: You say 'er, cloth'
12:45:48: Lortheim says 'from naurig?'
12:45:53: You say 'And captain.'
12:45:54: Lortheim says 'oh i finally got it'
12:45:59: You say 'I was happy yesterday'
12:46:01: Lortheim says 'just took 8 on cap and 10+ on the other'
12:46:03: You say 'SOMEONE did robe quest'
12:46:10: Lortheim says 'that's awesome'
12:46:10: You say 'And I walked into Goblin King to get a sceptre'
12:46:14: You say 'And 3-4 were laying on the ground'
12:46:26: Lortheim says 'maybe that was me?'
12:46:29: Lortheim says 'probably me'
12:46:31: You say 'Was a human'
12:46:36: You say 'I had fresh tracks.'
12:46:37: Lortheim says 'it WAS me'
12:46:41: You say 'Last time King was done, I was at Queen. :P'
12:46:41: Lortheim says 'shoulda tracked me!'
12:46:54: You say 'Nah. I was farming mystic gear. :P'
12:46:58: Lortheim says 'right on'
12:46:59: You say 'Got a few silver rings'
12:47:06: Lortheim says 'oh nice'
12:47:10: Lortheim says 'i ddn't get one to drop for me'
12:47:18: You say 'I went about 3/6'
12:47:26: You say 'I have an auto-curse trigger. :p'
12:47:34: You say 'So I literally attacked, and walked away for 15 minutes.'
12:47:38: You say 'Came back, attacked, walked away'
12:47:50: You say 'I'd be an easy target at that point if my AFK trigger hadn't fired yet :P'
12:48:15: You say 'I find it interesting you just lose lions everywhere. :P'
12:48:57: You say 'Numero Uno.'
12:49:05: Lortheim says 'very true'
12:49:07: Lortheim says 'the original'
12:49:42: You say 'It's really quite nice.  It's perfect for any conjurer to choose over a fine blue.'
12:49:48: Lortheim says 'i agree!'
12:50:01: Lortheim says 'pat disagrees, but him and george want crazy def on their mages and conjs'
12:50:10: You say 'That's unimportant.'
12:50:12: Lortheim says 'and from a design standpoint i completely disagree'
12:50:16: Muff chats 'so'
12:50:21: Muff chats 'that felt amazing'
12:50:21: You say 'You're going to get hit.  At that point, just prepare for the hits.'
12:50:24: Lortheim says 'impossible to kill a conj that's playing smart'
12:50:26: Lortheim chats 'you get paid?'
12:50:26: Muff chats 'i just laid into my boss'
12:50:30: Lortheim chats 'NICE!'
12:50:32: You say 'But not having to swap off a robe when switching from mental to physical smobs'
12:50:35: You say 'That's convenient.'

22:52:55: You chat 'Meh.  I'll just rework it and call them all "matches"'
22:53:00: Durzo chats 'lol'
22:53:14: You chat 'Because matches are what I get when the incoming line meets my regex requirements. :P'
22:53:34: Durzo chats 'ive yet to see if i can simplify my matches for offensive spells'

22:54:02: Durzo chats 'match*'
22:54:05: You chat 'Otherwise I'll have a bunch of embedded if's which I don't want.'
22:55:06: You chat 'Doing multiline matches, in my case, is pretty hard.'
22:55:18: You chat 'You only get one single line at a time, and I hate tracking that kind of thing.'
22:55:49: You chat 'Though! I'm a genius, kind of.'
22:55:51: Durzo chats 'the only way to reliably find out who cast things like confuse/hallucinate is to multiline match'
22:55:58: You chat 'I know how to break out of a sequence without looking for an empty line.'
22:56:50: You chat 'Yeah, that's true.  Such a pain. :P'
22:56:56: Durzo chats 'agreed'
22:57:18: Durzo chats 'i mean, ive got it working, but the regex looks ugly and uge'
22:57:19: Durzo chats 'huge*'
22:58:18: You chat 'Correcting that snaffu I had with parsing the string directly after doing a regex match... it fixed my auto-updating status bar. :P'
22:58:26: Durzo chats ':)'
22:58:43: You chat 'I guess my decimal parse was failing because there were spaces in the line I didn't account for, or something.'
22:58:51: You chat 'Hell if I know.'
22:59:11: You chat 'Added 6 color codes to the percentages though.'
22:59:34: You chat 'So it varies between green, yellow green, yellow, orange, orange-red, and red.'
23:00:32: Durzo chats 'i just realised i need to decapitalize all my strings i put into tables :('
23:00:58: You chat 'Hah, so I did the complete opposite, or at least with group members.'
23:01:13: You chat 'I capitalize the first letter right now (which would be bad if I track incoming damage)'
23:01:23: Durzo chats 'i already do that also'
23:01:27: You chat 'Though technically, I could do a case-insensitive match in regex.'
23:01:32: Durzo chats 'but, for tames its shit'
23:01:59: You chat 'You'll notice on regex101.com you have that option to set flags also, if you didn't look that hard.'
23:02:22: Durzo chats 'i didn't look that hard'
23:02:33: Durzo chats 'i noticed multiline'
23:02:36: You chat 'So i is the case insensitive match.  It's a little dropdown.'
23:02:37: Durzo chats 'which was a help'
23:02:56: You chat 'Yeah.  Check your regex against multiple different sequences at a time.'
23:03:11: Durzo chats 'sting, what you up to?'
23:04:48: You chat 'Ugh.  This auto-score thing would be PERFECT if I could hide my input.'
23:04:57: Durzo chats 'you can cant you'
23:05:01: You chat 'You just see it typing "score" with nothing else happening.'
23:05:14: Durzo chats 'isn't that just echo'
23:05:21: You chat 'Yeah, but I like echo. :P'
23:05:25: Durzo chats 'oh lol'
23:05:47: Durzo chats 'make your alias, to turn off echo when you type score'
23:05:52: Durzo chats 'actualy that wouldn't work'
23:05:59: You chat 'Odd.  It isn't JMC echo it doesn't look like.'
23:06:18: Durzo chats 'well thats good'
23:06:29: You chat 'Or it is, but turning echo off doesn't do shit.'
23:06:39: Durzo chats 'prolly the latter'
23:07:29: You chat 'I've gotta be missing something.  I'm going to browse around and read this full readme on the new JMC.'
23:07:46: Durzo chats 'hope you got your beers nearby'
23:08:02: You chat 'Not at all.  Haven't drank today. :P'

23:17:20: You chat 'I used to let people follow me when I was on spirit triggers.'
23:17:26: You chat 'Even had a trigger to group someone if they poked me.'
23:17:36: Durzo chats 'lol'
23:17:51: You chat 'Was open to all players, actually.  It was fairly effective for lowbies.'
23:23:05: Durzo chats 'not much, trying to overcome bad learning'
23:23:12: Zalero chats 'heh'
23:23:35: Durzo chats 'what about yourself'
23:25:17: You chat 'Hah. JMC supports EXACTLY what Andrew was referring to earlier!'
23:25:25: Durzo chats 'lol'
23:25:30: You chat 'They even have a sample script on how to use it.'
23:25:33: Zalero chats 'not much on my end. looking for something to do'
23:25:35: Durzo chats 'oh wow'
23:25:41: You chat 'Load a Telnet message into an XML document'

23:26:12: Durzo chats 'cuz bullys and berserkers are garbage'
23:28:13: You chat 'The new mapping features seem impressive too.  JMC allows importing of maps from TinTin++, ZMud, and MudMapper.'
23:28:21: Durzo chats 'hmm'
23:28:27: Durzo chats 'you used any of those before?'
23:28:30: Zalero chats 'yes durzo they are very much garbage, haha'
23:28:39: You chat 'Nossir, but someone mentioned Mudmapper today.'
23:29:20: Durzo chats 'i haven't touched mapping in a while'
23:29:28: Durzo chats 'but could probably give it another go again'
23:29:44: You chat 'omg...'
23:29:48: Durzo chats '?'
23:29:50: You chat 'I need to find someone who knows russian.'
23:30:00: You chat 'This didn't translate 100%'
23:30:03: Durzo chats 'translate isn't good enough?'
23:30:06: You chat 'But I catch the main point of what this is saying.'
23:30:23: You chat 'JMC can broadcast itself over a local network for communication from an external source.'
23:31:17: Zalero chats 'hrm...is there a meat guy in orc caves, i dont recall'
