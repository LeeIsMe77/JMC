20:49:17: You chat 'Well, it wasn't overly difficult to figure out. :O'
20:49:33: Sting chats 'captain is a weird one'
20:49:55: Sting chats 'however, i think kenny and i were thinking it.'
20:50:00: You chat 'The numenorian one?'
20:50:04: Sting chats 'yeah'
20:50:07: You chat '*nod*'
20:50:18: You chat 'So I did Vaz today.  Been trying to get a dragon shield, and have been having shitty luck.'
20:50:22: You chat 'Today was no different. :P'
20:50:27: You chat 'Shield loaded'
20:50:37: You chat 'But I was connected to my works VPN while I was doing it, and VPN lost internet.'
20:50:43: Sting chats ':s'
20:50:53: You chat 'Lost connection for like, 10 seconds before I thought to drop the VPN and viola, connected.'
20:51:00: You chat 'Came back bloodied though, so success.'
20:51:05: You chat 'Full load, went to take eye to Karugh.'
20:51:16: You chat 'Gave it to him... and I was carrying too much to be able to carry a 10lb bladder'
20:51:20: You chat 'So I lost that. :P'
20:51:33: You chat 'Granted, I had 2 more eyes, so meh.'
20:51:51: You chat 'Cut my 4th marble dagger in a row, with a marble dagger on a 31T'
20:51:52: Sting chats 'cool'
20:53:39: Sting chats 'i'm still not sure what to do with this robe...'
20:53:55: You chat 'I actually have a conjurer on darkie.  Not sure how I feel about him yet, he's still level 29.'
20:54:02: Sting chats 'i kinda don't want it'

20:56:45: You chat 'Well if you have a mage, you're more than welcome to help me kill whatever. :P'
20:56:51: You chat 'Got another hour or two before I go to bed.'
20:57:05: You chat 'Been getting some nice naps in around 2PM, and somehow I haven't been getting bothered with work during that period.'
20:58:49: Sting chats 'i have one mage over here and i don't like him at all.'
20:58:55: Sting chats 'this guy is 0m'
20:59:34: You chat 'Why not?'
21:00:47: Sting chats 'i'm just not a fan of mages'
21:00:50: Sting chats 'and their hps :p'
21:04:19: You chat 'I had dropped link, so lost all conversations, if you said something. :P'
21:04:41: Sting chats 'yeah i said i'm just not a fan of mages.... and their hps :p'
21:05:13: You chat 'fair enough.'
21:05:28: You chat 'I think their HP is the best part. :P'
21:05:42: Sting chats 'ewww'
21:05:52: You chat 'Holy hell.'
21:05:54: Sting chats 'why i hate lhuth'
21:06:14: You chat 'Still get 3.4k for vampire bats. :|'
21:06:25: Sting chats 'nice!'
21:06:43: Sting chats 'faroth is good solo also at 30ish'
21:08:35: You chat 'Yeah.  I took my ranger there the other day after I finally geared him some.'
21:08:41: You chat 'First time logging in like, 8 years on him.'
21:08:47: You chat 'As soon as I got there, a tiger attacked me.'
21:08:54: Sting chats 'ewww'
21:08:59: You chat 'Decided to try and kill tiger.  As soon as I stabbed him twice and stayed engaged, Nomad came to entrance'
21:09:15: Sting chats 'i took my puke ranger in there yesterday and couldn't see him to stab him after he was following :/'
21:09:43: You chat 'Awareness is still silly.'
21:09:50: You chat 'My guy is a 33R, and full awareness.'
21:09:56: You chat 'He could hardly see tiger'
21:10:02: You chat 'Had to get lucky flees to ent while engaged.'
21:10:13: Sting chats 'i'm 35r and can't see him but may not have awareness'
21:10:31: You chat 'Ah, well awareness is definitely a must.  It's almost not effective at all without it.'
21:11:16: You chat 'Ffs mages are such bullshit right now.'
21:11:30: You chat 'Dave had to go and make them suck and then take an extended vacation from programming. :S'
21:11:44: Sting chats 'lol'
21:11:49: Sting chats 'mystics rock!'
21:12:23: You chat 'Ewww, forgot webspinner actually locks door. :P'
21:12:34: Sting chats 'u make it out?'
21:12:44: You chat 'Yeah, chill ray finally worked without losing concentration.'
21:13:06: You chat 'Wearing thin/thick chain, I lose concentration about 25% of the time on preps and casts.'
21:13:28: You chat 'Against most mobs, as a cold spec, my chill/cone get resisted about 30-45% of the time.'
21:13:30: Sting chats 'really?'
21:13:35: You chat 'For example, Morungol resisted about 40% yesterday.'
21:13:38: Sting chats 'wearing chain does that kinda stuff?'
21:13:43: You chat 'Yeah, apparently.'
21:13:47: Sting chats ':s'
21:14:01: You chat 'Priest also resists a lot.'
21:14:07: You chat 'His formula was flawed from the getgo.'
21:14:16: You chat 'It compares a mages mage level to a mobs level.'
21:14:26: You chat 'Mage level, at most, can only hit 36(33)'
21:14:35: You chat 'There isn't technically a cap on mob level, except for like, 100'
21:14:55: You chat 'So against a mob that is level 20+, there is a good chance they will resist spells.'
21:15:06: Sting chats 'that's no good.'
21:15:32: You chat 'His solution is spell penetration.'
21:15:46: You chat 'And large mages will get it by default.  For every 5 levels of mage, you will get +1 spell penetration.'
21:16:05: Sting chats 'that sounds like a workaround.'
21:16:27: You chat 'Meh, kind of.  I understand where he's coming from, as it's hard to find a way to make big smobs hard not going off of level.'
21:16:33: You chat 'As like, 95% of smobs are warriors.'
21:16:51: You chat 'Maybe not 95%, but you get the point.'
21:16:56: You chat 'The good thing about spell penetration, though.'
21:16:57: Sting chats 'ya'
21:17:01: You chat 'Is that it can get added to equipment.'
21:17:15: You chat 'So mages will have a choice between mana regen, + maximum mana, or spell penetration.'
21:17:42: Sting chats 'interesting.'
21:17:43: You chat 'It adds a new dynamic, which I do like.'
21:18:40: You chat 'Sleeping.'
21:22:03: You chat 'Dag nabbit.'
21:22:09: Sting chats '?'
21:22:23: You chat 'Webspinner is being a prick.  2 tanks took him to low awful before shield drained me.'
21:23:20: You chat 'Not bad.  5.8k :)'
21:23:34: Sting chats 'that xp got buffed, right?'
21:23:36: Sting chats 'maze'
21:23:41: You chat 'Certainly seems like it.'
21:24:57: You chat 'Ick.'
21:25:12: You chat 'Had a bug in my map scripts today and caused like, 427 lines in errors in my log.'
21:25:53: Sting chats ':s'
21:26:08: Sting chats 'is it part of jmc?'
21:26:17: You chat 'Which part?'
21:26:20: You chat 'The log?'
21:26:22: Sting chats 'the map'
21:26:40: You chat 'Nah.  I don't know if it's the mapping you're thinking of.'
21:26:53: You chat 'I wrote some scripts that extract maps from a command such as examine map'
21:26:57: You chat 'And stores the maps in a collection'
21:27:10: You chat 'So you can display them on another screen, save them for later, etc.'
21:27:26: Sting chats 'can they be used to create a map of Arda?'
21:27:43: You chat 'Nah.  They rely on an actual map object.'
21:28:12: You chat 'So I began writing a program to take the world file and turn it into an excel map for Durg's zone.'
21:28:33: You chat 'I realized after I got the rooms loaded up into memory that it's going to be a son of a bitch getting them drawn in excel.'
21:29:01: You chat 'The problem with zone files is that not all rooms require exits.'
21:29:25: You chat 'So where do you draw a room that has no exits, or no rooms leading to it?'
21:32:49: You chat 'Know what I would like to see for some odd reason? :O'
21:32:59: Sting chats 'what's that?'
21:33:09: You chat 'I think the tell or chat channel should be opened up to people who are sleeping.'
21:33:30: Sting chats 'uh no lol'
21:33:35: You chat 'or a new channel for out-of-character.'
21:33:50: Sting chats 'i don't like it :p'
21:33:51: You chat 'It's not like people don't use messenger or texts already.'
21:34:05: Sting chats 'however chats/narrates/whispers/ should be broken out into their own window'
21:34:20: You chat 'Meh, that's not for Matt/Seth/Dave to do.'
21:34:25: You chat 'It's easily doable from JMC.'
21:34:38: You chat 'Or any other client, for that matter.'
21:34:51: Sting chats 'output windows?'
21:34:56: You chat 'I display all of my socials in my main screen, plus another copy with a timestamp on another screen.'
21:34:57: You chat 'Yes.'
21:35:12: You chat '21:34:38: You chat 'Or any other client, for that matter.''
21:36:07: You chat 'I also log all of my socials now to text files by date.'
21:37:00: Sting chats 'cool'
21:37:07: You chat 'I don't really know why, at this point.'
21:37:16: You chat 'But if any issues ever come up with players acting up'
21:37:20: You chat 'I at least have logs to back me up. :P'
21:37:26: Sting chats 'nod.'
21:39:07: You chat 'Hmmm, do golden bracelets go to Karugh also?'
21:39:25: Sting chats 'yes'
21:39:30: Sting chats 'for tainted.'
21:39:50: You chat 'Word, thanks.'
21:40:04: You chat 'My memory sucks.  I'm burned myself out.'
21:40:11: Sting chats ':p'
21:54:15: Sting chats 'tip'
21:54:17: You chat 'See yah'
21:54:22: You chat 'Have a nice night.'
21:54:28: Sting chats 'you too!'
