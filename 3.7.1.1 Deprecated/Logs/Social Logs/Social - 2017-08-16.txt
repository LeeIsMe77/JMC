08:50:02: You yell 'hi'

09:08:08: Ranak chats '=('
09:08:11: Ranak chats 'well probably'
10:20:58: You chat 'Chugging along, aren't you Ranak? :o'
10:21:09: Ranak chats 'spam cast, rest, spam cast, rest'
10:21:10: Ranak chats 'lol'
10:21:24: You chat 'Got your 20 mana dark bolt? :O'
10:21:59: Ranak chats 'yes!'
10:22:13: Ranak chats 'liking leach still, but maybe next level i switch'
10:30:51: You sing 'Ishi ishi ishi, can't you see? Sometimes your deaths just hypnotize me...'
10:31:10: Ishi chats 'suck a dick'
10:31:16: You sing 'I just love your crafty ways, so tell me how you're gonna die today.'
10:31:40: You chat 'That was my Biggy Smalls rendition. :O'
11:17:20: Ishi chats 'hey im alive'
11:17:28: Ranak chats 'yay!'
11:17:31: Ranak chats 'you went afk?'
11:17:37: Ishi chats 'office internet went down'
11:17:42: Ranak chats 'fun'
11:26:59: Ishi chats 'all those deaths paid off. int hike :P'
11:28:35: Ranak chats 'yay!'
11:28:40: Ranak chats 'i only got a dex hike so far'
11:34:31: You chat 'Dex hikes are lovely if you care about fleeing in tight spaces. :)'
11:34:42: Ranak chats 'Str: 16/16, Int: 18/18, Wil: 10/10, Dex: 17/17, Con: 16/16, Lea: 15/15.'
11:34:48: Ranak chats 'yeah but my dex was okay before lol'
11:34:53: You chat '17 dex, however, is a bit excessive. :P'
11:35:24: You chat 'I did some digging on the help stat screen :P'
11:35:38: You chat 'I was interested in whether or not all those "Normals" were actually normal for lhuths.'
11:35:53: Ranak chats 'they must not be'
11:36:00: Ranak chats 'i couldn't get a 19 int'
11:36:04: You chat 'They're not, but they're close.'
11:36:10: You chat 'Int is -1 from humans.'
11:36:35: You chat 'What was interesting was con.'
11:36:41: You chat 'Con is actually +1 over humans.'
11:36:51: Ranak chats '20?'
11:36:56: You chat 'Yessir, I do believe so.'
11:36:59: Ranak chats 'crazy'
11:38:35: You chat '{-1,-1,-3, 0, 1,-2, 0, 0}'
11:38:48: You chat 'So -1 str, -1 int, -3 will, same dex, +1 con, -2 lea.'
11:39:13: Ranak chats 'well how about that'
11:39:16: You chat 'Overall, it appears a 94 statsum is possible.'
11:39:22: Ranak chats 'then why can't i roll good con lol!'
11:39:32: You chat 'Con is a tricky stat'
11:39:33: Ranak chats 'boooooooooo'
11:39:39: Ranak chats 'i have 92 sum'
11:39:47: You chat 'There are situations where con can actually be placed as the 5th lowest stat'
11:39:54: You chat 'And others where it's the 3rd lowest.'
11:39:58: You chat 'All depending on coefs.'
11:40:17: Ranak chats 'yeah gotta have warrior first to get it as 3rd i think'
11:40:41: You chat 'Yeah.  And then to get max con, you'd have to stat max str/something else also.'
11:40:46: You chat 'Where the something is your secondary, I believe.'
11:41:52: You chat 'Either way, food for thought. :)  Should be Low|Low|Very Low|Normal|High|Low (or perhaps Very Low)'
11:42:08: Ranak chats 'yes it should!'
11:42:12: You chat 'Unless Normal provides the +/- 1 buffer.'
11:42:40: Ranak chats 'how does one infer the intention of the creators?'
11:42:49: Ranak chats 'sometimes changing things feels like intrepreting the bible'
11:42:56: Ranak chats 'what did they INTEND 20 years ago lol'
11:43:01: You chat 'If +/- 1 was inferred, it's still wrong. :P'
11:43:07: You chat 'Because then str should be Normal :P'
11:43:33: Ranak chats 'i think the answer is to make them stat with +1 int'
11:43:40: Ranak chats 'but that's just like, my opinion man'
11:43:52: You chat 'Lol.  That's what they wanted to do, but they typoed.'
11:44:01: Ranak chats 'i feel like that's the case, yeah'
11:44:16: You chat 'We could then infer that the entire MUD is a typo.'
11:44:33: Ranak chats 'hahahahaha'
11:45:33: You chat 'Of course, I think at this point, the original intention is a moot point.  I think it's safe to say yours, Seth's, and Dave's intentions are all that matter going forward.'
11:47:49: Ranak chats 'hmmmm, i suppose so.....'
11:47:53: Ranak chats 'all lhuths get +5 int'
11:47:57: Ranak chats 'retroactive'
11:48:46: You chat 'Hah'
11:48:54: You chat 'Oldkarvok would have to come out of retirement. :P'
11:49:06: Ranak chats 'oh god no'
11:49:16: Ranak chats 'a 24m lhuth.  how the fuck did i ever get kills man'
11:49:52: Ranak chats 'i couldn't even use spear really'
11:49:55: You chat 'Good question, but it is safe to assume that A) Skill had to do with it (or lack of by the targets)'
11:50:03: You chat 'B) Stupidity of ever raiding lhuth caves. :P'
11:50:06: Ranak chats 'hahahahhaa'
11:50:14: You chat 'C) I don't believe spellsave worked back then.'
11:50:19: You chat 'And if it did, most people have negative. :P'
11:50:26: Ranak chats 'i'm not claiming that i was ever the greatest or anything'
11:50:28: Ranak chats 'BUT'
11:50:41: Ranak chats 'i think the reason a lot of people got mad at us was because we couldn't win by brute force/tracking/open fights'
11:50:45: Ranak chats 'so we made them follow us into traps'
11:51:10: Ranak chats 'and i think, rather consciously or subconciously, that's what made them mad.  not dying, but being out-manouvered'
11:52:38: You chat 'Really, that's the best tactic a lhuth could ever do.  They're not equipt to play like a normal player.'
11:53:03: Ranak chats 'which is why i liked them so much, cause i've always been bad at tracking lol'
11:53:30: You chat 'Hah, yeah.  Locate was always my best friend, and intuition.'
11:53:43: You chat 'When targets are predictable, that far outweighs track skills.'
11:53:55: Ranak chats 'so true'
11:54:14: You chat 'I wonder how poor track is these days with it being around 50% :O'
11:54:22: Ranak chats 'it's not great'
11:54:23: You chat 'I'd think it works fairly decent outside of winter.'
11:54:23: Ranak chats 'LOL'
12:04:42: Maool chats 'hello'
12:04:46: Ranak chats 'hi maool1'
12:04:49: You chat 'Howdy'
12:04:58: Maool chats 'nice to see some lhuths :)'
12:05:12: You chat 'They've been fairly regular lately. :)'
12:05:21: Ranak chats 'i blame it on atomos'
12:05:32: You chat 'I blame everything on Atomos.  He's an artard.'
12:05:35: Ranak chats 'told me he was making a lhuth and i finally decided to make a REAL lhuth'
12:05:38: Maool chats 'lol'
12:05:46: Maool chats 'how are the stats?'
12:05:59: Ranak chats 'Str: 16/16, Int: 18/18, Wil: 10/10, Dex: 17/17, Con: 16/16, Lea: 15/15.'
12:06:08: Ranak chats 'too high, but i statted 18 int 16 con, so i had to take it'
12:06:18: Maool chats 'yeah, not bad'
12:06:31: You chat 'My new guy statted 18 int 14 con, and had an 83~ sum :O'
12:06:46: Ranak chats 'yeah atomos in the money on that one'
12:06:58: You chat 'Bling bling, and stuff.'
12:07:10: You chat 'May have been an 85 sum though... my memory is horrible.'
12:07:11: Maool chats 'I haven't played since 2006'
12:07:32: You chat 'Ah, it was 84.'
12:08:03: Maool chats 'when i logged in last night I was in the uruk home'
12:08:13: Maool chats 'nearly died so many times'
12:08:17: Ranak chats 'doh!'
12:08:30: Maool chats 'was super hard to find lhuth home again'
12:08:31: You chat 'Haha, that's rough.  I think I got out before it was re-populated.'
12:09:30: Maool chats 'anyways, im off. just checking who is around. maybe i will see yall later'
12:09:34: Maool chats 'PK is still a thing right?'
12:09:45: You chat 'It was abolished after the third cold war.'
12:09:49: You chat 'But yes. :P'
12:10:05: Maool chats 'cool :)'
12:11:28: You chat 'What they fail to mention in history class is that all wars in or around Russia are cold wars, not just the verbal war against Russia... :O'
13:42:06: Eek chats 'yo'

14:00:17: Eek chats 'You have 93 practice sessions left'

14:00:59: Ranak chats 'he really low mage or something?'
14:01:12: Eek chats '0r'
14:01:17: Ranak chats 'DOH!'
14:02:37: Eek chats 'still a fun char to play'
14:02:54: Eek chats 'but I really wish eq trading was legal when trying to get him an eye, hehe'
14:03:58: Ranak chats 'right?'
