00:03:35: You say 'Huh? :P'
00:03:38: Gilgamesh says 'stand'
00:03:38: You say 'Rest, right?'
00:03:41: You say 'Oh.'
00:04:17: You say 'Gotta vit.'
00:04:22: Gilgamesh says 'anyone remember the door names'
00:04:34: Ogmar says 'where are we?'
00:04:51: Ogmar says 'nm'
00:04:56: Gilgamesh says 'straight up man'
00:05:06: Gilgamesh says 'bash confuse'
00:05:07: Ogmar says 'i don't remember door names i usually search it out'
00:05:08: Gilgamesh says 'we all here'
00:05:15: Gilgamesh says 'how bout you d'
00:05:16: You say 'warlock huh?'
00:05:17: Ogmar says 'kill 2. and bash man'
00:05:22: You say 'Ready.'
00:06:10: You say 'He loads 2 rings?!'
00:06:14: Ogmar says 'yeah'
00:06:16: You say 'wtf'
00:06:23: Ogmar says 'always has'
00:06:30: You say 'Not before he moved. :S'
00:06:32: Ogmar says 'only full set you can get in game i believe'
00:06:36: You say 'I don't think.'
00:06:39: Ogmar says 'from single mob kill that is'
00:06:46: Sting says 'think i'm out now'
00:06:53: You say 'Granted, I haven't done him since he moved.'
00:07:05: Ogmar group-says 'lost me'
00:07:10: Gilgamesh group-says 'where at?'
00:07:20: Ogmar group-says 'shit few rooms ago'
00:07:27: Ogmar group-says 'where you heading?'
00:07:33: Gilgamesh group-says 'to east ent of spec'
00:07:43: Ogmar group-says 'ok heading there'
00:09:29: Ogmar says 'no hike'
00:09:33: Gilgamesh says 'bugger'
00:09:54: You group-say 'Mutilate Statistics:'
00:10:03: You say 'Didn't have my group set up. :P'

00:10:48: Gilgamesh says 'can do'
00:10:52: You say 'Add an integer to each character'
00:10:57: You say 'And a function to do the math'
00:11:09: Gilgamesh says 'se'
00:11:10: Gilgamesh says 'sec'

00:14:27: You say 'Uh'
00:14:27: You say '/'
00:14:39: You say 'Make sure they're decimals first. :O'
00:14:43: You say 'Idk how perl works'
00:14:49: You say 'But you might need to multiple them by 1.0'
00:14:56: You say 'Before dividing.'
00:15:17: Sting says 'just uses parentheses :)'
00:15:19: Sting says 'use*'
00:15:37: You say 'Well, in programming, 4 / 3 == 1'
00:15:53: You say 'Integer division always yields an integer.'
00:16:08: You say '4.0 / 3.0 == 1.333'
00:16:08: Sting says 'boo integer division'
00:16:15: Sting says 'float it'

00:16:31: Ogmar says 'cool'
00:17:28: You say 'I need to add that stuff to my group reporting.'
00:17:38: You say 'Before I do that, I need to make a way to update my group members without purging the collection.'
00:17:39: Gilgamesh says 'do you capture all the hits yet?'
00:17:46: You say 'Nah. Just mutilates.'
00:17:59: You say 'I was trying to watch how much regex I did, because I didn't wanna bog it down.'
00:18:08: You say 'But this shit is still fast, and I've added a lot.'
00:18:18: You say 'Refined a lot of my original ones now that I know regex fairly well'
00:18:18: Gilgamesh says 'i haven't had any problem'
00:18:23: You say 'So they require less passes, and are more accurate'
00:18:26: Gilgamesh says 'and ive got a fair amount of regexp'
00:18:38: You say 'And since I got all the BOMs and ansi color codes stripped, I can anchor everything as well.'
00:19:07: Gilgamesh says 'i luckily dont have to bother stripping :)'
00:19:12: You say 'I was afraid it was my regex causing JMC 3.7.1.0 to bog down, but it appears it was just a bug there.'
00:19:30: You say 'A simple extension/prototype solved that.'
00:19:38: You say 'Of course, by simple I mean "took me hours to figure out"'
00:20:27: You say 'So I guess I have functions to add/remove members manually.'
00:20:40: You say 'I'd really like to just have it "update" the group when you type group.'
00:20:51: You say 'Remove members who aren't there, add new ones.'
00:20:55: Ogmar says 'afk a sec'
00:21:06: Gilgamesh says 'that doesn't sound so hard'
00:21:29: Gilgamesh says 'i track all my group members anyway'
00:21:34: You say 'It shouldn't be, but I may need to maintain a "temporary" collection of names.'
00:21:40: You say 'And compare it to the existing collection.'
00:22:25: You say 'Ew, that regex got updated heavily.'
00:22:32: You say 'Originally I was capturing the line.'
00:22:34: You say 'Then splitting on the --'
00:22:40: You say 'And stripping of the "(head of group)'
00:22:51: You say 'Had no idea how well regex could work in that situation :P'
00:23:01: Gilgamesh says 'i use a wait coroutine'
00:23:22: Ogmar says 'back'
00:23:48: Gilgamesh says 'basically, i give it captures criteria i specify'
00:23:53: Gilgamesh says 'until a condition is met'
00:24:05: Gilgamesh says 'which is usually a blank line'
00:24:19: Gilgamesh says 'everything is then saved into a table'
00:24:22: You say 'For things like practice sessions, I had to get tricky.'
00:24:31: Sting says 'i'm think i'm done for the night'
00:24:32: You say 'I had to define 2 boolean values.'
00:24:36: Gilgamesh says 'ill head to glob'
00:24:39: Gilgamesh says 'think i am too'
00:24:41: You say 'Am I looking for practice sessions, and have I found practice sessions.'
00:24:43: Gilgamesh says 'can divvy up gear there'
00:24:47: You say 'Because that blank line can pop up sometimes.'
00:25:01: Ogmar says 'can i get sac?'
00:25:06: Sting says 'of balls?'
00:25:07: Gilgamesh says 'sure'
00:25:13: Ogmar says 'yes balls'
00:25:58: You say 'I think tomorrow I'll expand the group thing to do hits/damage.  You did a good implementation, and I like it.'
00:26:29: Gilgamesh says 'i started off with mute count too'
00:26:37: Gilgamesh says 'but when light fighting spec gets the change'
00:26:46: Gilgamesh says 'im interested more in party damage output'
00:26:58: Gilgamesh says 'i also track mobs'
00:26:59: Gilgamesh says '229 mobs killed, 82 different mob types'
00:27:02: You say 'Makes sense.  MUT count was for the thrill'
00:27:05: Gilgamesh says 'To level: 65,883 XP (2 h) 243 average kills. (35,513 XP/hour)'
00:27:12: You say 'But seeing average damage output per hit'
00:27:20: Ogmar says 'anyone sticking around?'
00:27:21: You say 'I'd love to put timers on them as well, and do hits per second.'
00:27:25: You say 'Or hits per minute.'
00:27:39: Sting says 'per second would be best prolly'
00:28:04: You say 'It's hard to track though, because you'd really need to know the state of fighting vs not fighting.'
00:28:13: Gilgamesh says 'and you cant be sure of that'
00:28:27: Gilgamesh says 'unless you reset their state after a kill'
00:28:34: Gilgamesh says 'but if you are both fighitng different mobs'
00:28:38: You say 'And start it when they attack.'
00:28:43: You say 'But turning mobs is hard.'
00:28:48: Gilgamesh says 'it is'
00:28:50: Gilgamesh says 'ok'
00:28:51: Gilgamesh says 'so gear'
00:28:52: You say 'Cause then they're getting rescued, and regenerating energy'
00:29:04: Gilgamesh says 'wwf, ww heart'
00:29:07: Gilgamesh says 'blue robe'
00:29:08: You say 'and B&G boots.'
00:29:11: Gilgamesh says 'serp hammer'
00:29:13: Gilgamesh says 'cup'
00:29:20: Gilgamesh says 'wolf fur'
00:29:22: Gilgamesh says 'cowl'
00:29:26: Ogmar says 'i want to roll on robe for lowb and spider sac'
00:30:01: You say 'groll? Or individual rolls?'
00:30:28: You say 'I'd like robe.  If it's that important to Ogmar, he can take it.'
00:30:46: Ogmar says 'nah go for it'
00:30:58: You say 'Does your lowbie have anything right now?'
00:31:19: Ogmar says 'umm yeah some hand me downs, i'm leasurly leveling him'
00:31:21: Sting says 'i guess i'll get heart'
00:31:23: Ogmar says 'not a requirement right now'
00:31:35: Sting says 'and i'm out for rest'
00:31:36: Ogmar says 'he's 9'
00:31:38: Ogmar says 'thanks'
00:31:45: Sting says 'thanks for the group guys'
00:31:49: You say 'Thank you stinger'
00:31:49: Gilgamesh says 'got two stone rings here also'
00:31:55: Gilgamesh says 'cheers sting'
00:32:46: You say 'erm, still have shinies, B&G boots, sapphirine'
00:33:00: Gilgamesh says 'i could use kite i guess'
00:33:19: Gilgamesh says '2 less def'
00:33:27: Gilgamesh says 'but spell save'
00:33:37: Gilgamesh says 'cowl, furs still here'
00:33:54: Gilgamesh says 'and got a lucern hammer if someone wants a tarnished sickle'
00:33:57: Ogmar says 'i'd say just hold for lowbs'
00:34:09: Ogmar says 'trad that hammer in for sick to drop weight'
00:34:18: Ogmar says 'ooozing is best'
00:34:21: Gilgamesh says 'i cbf running up there'
00:35:12: Ogmar says 'cbf?'
00:35:20: Ogmar says 'D are you renting?'
00:35:21: Gilgamesh says 'couldn't be fucked'
00:35:22: You say 'cbf?'
00:35:31: You say 'I may be, unsure.'
00:35:46: Ogmar says 'well if you want to xp some i'll be around for a bit'
00:35:54: Ogmar says 'think i'm about to step outside the house for a sec'
00:36:02: Ogmar says 'afk a min and i'll be back'
00:36:06: Ogmar says 'thanks for group G'

00:37:55: Durzo chats '37 and still 83 sum :s'
00:40:45: Durzo chats 'aight, im out, cheers boys'
00:42:30: Ogmar says 'ok'
00:42:44: You say 'I actually think i'ma be idle for a bit.'
00:42:48: Ogmar says 'ok'
00:43:08: Ogmar says 'what your name if you don't mind me asking'
00:43:16: Ogmar says 'mine is jake'
09:56:36: Kutter chats 'nah'
09:56:42: Kutter chats 'i have a 30w 15r'
09:56:51: Morgos chats 'like it, dont like it?'
09:56:57: Kutter chats 'love it'
09:57:00: Kutter chats 'Synic'
09:57:04: Morgos chats 'standard w?'
09:57:12: Kutter chats 'switch mystic/mage'
09:57:25: Kutter chats 'so i think its 9t 9m for an uruk'
09:57:28: Kutter chats 'because of malus'
09:58:02: Morgos chats 'not sure what i was thinkinng with this guy'
09:58:25: Morgos chats '33t'
09:58:26: Kutter chats '27w 20r?'
09:58:29: Kutter chats 'oh'
09:58:54: Morgos chats 'i think i made it in a hurry'
09:59:54: Morgos chats 'not sure id make another t bigger than 30 on uruk'
09:59:55: Kutter chats '33t isnt bad'
10:00:05: Kutter chats 'i have 4 or so 36ts'
10:00:23: Morgos chats 'i dont like 36t'
10:00:48: Morgos chats 'even though the powers are better, i hate not being able to hit'
10:01:05: Kutter chats 'i got a lot of pks racked up between all of them :o'
10:01:26: Morgos chats 'i wouldn't pk as a big mystic'
10:01:32: Morgos chats 'dont find it very rewarding'
10:01:38: Morgos chats 'even if they are successful'
10:02:34: Morgos chats 'shit, i forgot the warrior orc i had started'
10:02:41: Morgos chats 'fuck, what was his name'
10:03:11: Morgos chats 'remembered!'
10:10:31: Kutter says 'want a cowl?'
10:10:37: You say 'Sure, why not. :O'
10:10:47: You say 'Thanks sir.'
10:11:02: You say 'Whopping 112 defense now. :D'
10:11:15: You say 'Want some B&G boots?'
10:11:27: Kutter says 'not on this char'
10:11:54: You say 'Well you're welcome to them for as long as I possess them. :)'
10:12:21: You chat 'Oh yeah.'
10:12:36: You chat 'Altering that ansi regex got it down from 101 steps to 12 steps.'
10:12:54: Gilgamesh chats 'nice'
10:14:36: Gilgamesh chats 'ok, lets see if i can modify it like yours'
10:15:02: Gilgamesh chats 'so, your regexp that you pull out to anchor, is that a trigger?'
10:16:32: You chat 'Erm, huh?'
10:16:45: You chat 'When I replace the beginning of the line where the HP/MV/MP is?'
10:16:53: Gilgamesh chats 'you were saying you pull all the stuff before >'
10:17:08: You chat 'I eliminate it.  Sanitize the incoming line.'
10:17:22: You chat 'If it WERE going to be a trigger, it would be easy to switch to.'
10:17:52: You chat 'It's impossible to make anything in-game that will trigger off of that stuff, because it's not always present and it's not good for getting an accurate reading.'
10:18:10: Gilgamesh chats 'yeah, im not using it for anything'
10:19:08: Gilgamesh chats 'not sure if i want to get rid of it though'
10:19:34: Gilgamesh chats 'i currently have colour highlights to show different stages of health/mana/moves'
10:19:53: You chat 'Oh, so when I receive my incoming line'
10:20:00: You chat 'I store the sanitized line in a new variable.'
10:20:03: You chat 'And pass that in.'
10:20:14: You chat 'That way I don't interfere with the actual color codes passing to the client.'
10:22:20: You chat 'Ahh, do you ever use regex101.com?'
10:22:27: Gilgamesh chats 'nope'
10:22:31: You chat 'It's a great regex tester'
10:22:47: You chat 'Give them the expression, and your test criteria, and it'll update in real time.'
10:23:01: Gilgamesh chats 'oh wow'
10:23:41: Gilgamesh chats 'gonna try and simplify my regex for capturing hits'
10:28:52: Gilgamesh chats 'hmm'
10:29:30: Gilgamesh chats 'does this look right'
10:29:39: Gilgamesh chats 'You deeply wound a dirty black rat with your slash!'
10:29:56: Gilgamesh chats 'or am i missing your deadly slash!'
10:30:01: You chat 'Haha.  I'm going through the damage messages now to try and figure that out.'
10:30:08: You chat 'But deadly only appears on mutilates.'
10:30:26: You chat 'But you could easily do (?:deadly )?'
10:31:07: You chat '?: just means don't capture, in javascript world.  I don't know if it has the same meaning for you.'
10:31:17: Gilgamesh chats 'yup'
10:31:20: Gilgamesh chats 'same for me'
10:31:31: Gilgamesh chats '? after is optional case'
10:31:38: You chat 'Yessir.'
10:34:35: You chat '^[a-zA-Z] (?:(MUTILATE|severely wound|deeply wound)s?) [a-zA-Z' ] (?:body|head|arm|leg|foot) with (his|your|its|her) (?:deadly )? (weaponType)(?:.|!|!!)$'
10:34:50: You chat 'That MIGHT be it, though obviously I'm missing weapon types and might have body parts wrong.'
10:35:21: Gilgamesh chats 'you could probably drop the body parts i think'
10:35:35: Gilgamesh chats 'unless you plan on capturing the mob name'
10:35:41: You chat 'I could, but doing exact word matches like that often cost less time to process.'
10:36:25: Gilgamesh chats 'if i wanted [a-zA-Z] to include tames or followers'
10:36:30: Gilgamesh chats 'what would it look like'
10:36:38: You chat 'If you wanted that, add a space and apostrophe, I believe.'
10:36:54: You chat 'The regex is wrong, I just plugged it in.  I typed it in JMC though so lemme see if I can fix it.'
10:37:21: Gilgamesh chats 'im trying to see if i can come up with only 1 generic capture for hits'
10:38:47: Gilgamesh chats 'what does putting a + after it do'
10:40:56: You chat 'matches 1 or more of the previous match.'
10:41:03: You chat 'So yeah, I messed that up.'
10:41:06: You chat 'Right now I've got:'
10:41:10: You chat '([a-zA-Z ]+) (?:(MUTILATE|severely wound|deeply wound|scratch))(?:es|s)?'
10:41:44: Gilgamesh chats 'i haven't bothered with scratch yet'
10:42:46: Gilgamesh chats 'hit,slash,pound,smite,crush,whip,flail,pierce,stab,cleave'
10:42:49: Gilgamesh chats 'have i missed any?'
10:43:27: You chat 'I don't believe so.'
10:43:41: You chat 'Though if beornings come in, there may be a claw :)'
10:43:58: Gilgamesh chats 'will be an easy addition'
10:44:01: You chat 'Well, it'd be bare-handed weapon fighting.'
10:46:38: Gilgamesh chats 'how does the scratch msg go?'
10:47:09: You chat '"$n scratches $N#s#b with $s #w.",'
10:47:16: You chat '"$CHYou scratch $N#s#b as you #w $M."'
10:47:27: You chat '"$CD$n scratches you#r#b as $e #W you." },'
10:48:17: Gilgamesh chats 'what is #w and $M'
10:48:59: You chat '#w is weapon'
10:49:03: You chat 'slash, pierce, stab, etc.'
10:49:30: You chat '$M I have no idea.  That's the only message it appears in.'
10:50:06: You chat 'Oh.'
10:50:15: You chat 'It's gender.'
10:50:19: You chat 'his|her|its'
10:50:28: You chat 'er, him|her|it'
10:51:17: Gilgamesh chats 'ah'
10:51:39: Gilgamesh chats 'not sure ill worry about scratch'
10:51:48: Gilgamesh chats 'its 1 hp'
10:53:07: You chat 'But it does impact average damage a lot. :)'
10:53:40: Gilgamesh chats 'thats true'
10:55:37: Gilgamesh chats 'in the case im trying to do it in one regexp'
10:55:58: Gilgamesh chats 'is it efficient to do optional spaces'
10:56:11: Gilgamesh chats '(\s)?'
10:57:27: You chat 'Hmm.  I prefer not using it because it covers all of your carriage return and new line things.'
10:57:43: You chat 'As far as efficiency goes, I'm not positive.'
10:57:55: Gilgamesh chats 'are you splitting yours into two?'

11:07:36: You chat 'Characters name is too greedy.'
11:07:53: Gilgamesh chats 'i thought its because it can end in a full stop'
11:08:01: Gilgamesh chats 'You lightly hit a dirty black rat.'
11:08:17: Gilgamesh chats 'barely, lightly and normal hits just end with .'

11:19:06: Gilgamesh chats 'how do i read this regex101'
11:19:11: Gilgamesh chats 'to see if it works'
11:19:43: You chat 'So that is for using the matches functions, which would return an array of results.'
11:19:58: You chat 'Check the results for each group to see if anything matches the single word you are looking for.'
11:20:01: Gilgamesh chats 'ah i see, you can check to see which groups are capturing'
11:20:12: You chat 'You'll notice for very/extremely, they're capturing "hard" and only hard.'

11:21:05: You chat 'I've split lines into categories.'
11:22:34: Gilgamesh chats 'so im looking for hard, very hard and extremely hard to be in a separate group?'
11:24:06: Gilgamesh chats 'cant you perform a search on the string anyway to see if very or extremely is in the description?'
11:24:07: You chat 'And possible a normal hit.'
