09:44:32: Ranak chats 'oh god no!'
09:44:36: You chat 'Bwahahaha'
09:44:42: Ranak chats 'but enough defense to reduce the hits a bit'
09:44:51: You chat 'Kenny has racked up 6 mobdeaths now on his lhuth.'
09:44:59: You chat 'He's level 7.'

09:45:52: You chat 'All over, from bed to plant.'
09:45:57: Ranak chats 'well that the way to do it'
09:46:01: You chat 'Headed up to Enchanted path the other day'
09:46:11: You chat 'And he instantly got attacked by 2 elves, twice.'
09:46:19: Ranak chats 'i'd stay away from there'
09:46:28: You chat 'It seemed like a bright idea at first.'
09:47:02: You chat 'He's about to leave for another vacation, so I may need to continue without him. :O'
09:47:10: Ranak chats 'nice, where's he going?'
09:47:13: Ranak chats 'what level you at?'
09:47:16: You chat 'Ocean City again.'
09:47:20: Ranak chats 'hah nice'
09:47:27: You chat '8, 6k to 9'
09:47:31: Ranak chats 'nice'
09:47:43: You chat 'Decided to XP this guy some yesterday.'
09:47:59: Ranak chats 'looks like grudge found ya'
09:48:02: You chat 'Went AFK to grab a bite to eat, came back to a death from Grudge, who constantly hit me at wimpy. >.>'
09:48:15: Ranak chats 'i'm not shocked'
09:48:16: You chat 'Bounced me about 4-5 rooms.'
09:48:43: You chat 'Some people just don't respect the players.  It's okay though, I'll bite his ankles the next time I see him.'
09:49:17: Ranak chats 'just between you and i, he's really bad about complaining anytime ANYTHING happens to him, but he doesn't give a shit about fucking with other people'
09:49:47: You chat 'I can understand that.  I'm unfamiliar with who he is, except that he may be Tantrum.  That all still doesn't help me. :P'
09:51:03: You chat 'Ugh.  This work is getting too much to handle.  I have 190 files I've changed on this update so far.  I'm getting lost in them. :p'
09:51:13: Ranak chats 'ish'
10:02:15: You chat 'Ahhh I love Wells Fargo and this Zelle thing.'
10:16:04: Ranak chats 'what's happening with wells fargo and Zelle?'
10:19:44: You chat 'It's a service to transfer money from one account to another by phone number for free.'
10:20:06: You chat 'Makes paying my rent to Kenny very easy, and I never need to go to the bank anymore. :P'
10:22:14: You say 'open'
10:22:49: You chat 'Ashen warhorse tracks clear at dfr. :P'
10:35:44: Ranak chats 'ooooohhhh'
10:35:48: Ranak chats 'how long ago was that?'
10:44:21: You chat 'Erm'
10:44:25: You chat '20 minutes.'
10:44:35: You chat '22  minutes actually.'
10:45:15: Ranak chats 'hmmmmm'
10:45:25: Ranak chats '4k to go, then i log nicci and see if i can say hello to him'
10:45:42: You chat 'Word. :P'
10:51:21: You chat 'So you should make sure to be on tonight so we have someone else to XP with. :P'
10:53:24: You chat 'So you should make sure to be on tonight so we have someone else to XP with. :P'
10:53:40: Ranak chats 'hahahaha i can be on from like 8-9ish'
10:53:43: Ranak chats 'then hard knocks!'
10:53:56: You chat 'Oh boy. :P'
10:54:14: You chat 'So the Ravens got a new Quarterback yesterdayish. :P'
10:54:20: Ranak chats 'who was it?'
10:54:22: You chat 'It wasn't Kaepernick either.'
10:54:45: You chat 'Thaddeus Lewis'
10:55:07: Ranak chats 'oh that bodes well'
10:55:08: Ranak chats 'lol'
10:55:43: You chat 'Does it? :O'
10:55:47: Ranak chats 'ding!'
10:56:21: You chat 'I think they're looking to get rid of Mallet.'
10:56:26: You chat 'Mallett, whatever.'
10:56:35: You chat 'Guy looked terrible in the first preseason game.'
10:56:39: Ranak chats 'good, mallet is mediocore at best'
10:57:13: Ranak chats 'karvok is missing'
10:57:36: You chat 'Interesting.  Someone must be trying to kill Magus, perhaps?'
10:57:45: Ranak chats 'magus already been killed it looks like'
10:57:55: You chat 'Kind of irritating.  Seems like the same person has been killing Magus consistently every single day for as long as I can remember.'
10:58:03: Ranak chats 'it IS the same person'
10:58:16: Ranak chats 'log in the mornings and wait for him to come in lol'
10:58:25: You chat 'Yeah.  I hate when people do that.'
10:58:38: Ranak chats 'the only reason i don't is because i feel like it would be 'insider knowledge' for me'
10:58:47: Ranak chats 'even though everyone knows it's done daily by the same person'
10:58:52: You chat 'I can understand running something often if you need it and don't have it.  But really, dude has to have a million sets of shards now.'
10:59:04: Ranak chats 'the fact that i have an imm makes me feel shitty about doing it'
10:59:15: You chat 'Meh, I wouldn't.  You have the right. :P'
10:59:18: Ranak chats 'hahaha, nah, shards are like 2% load.  maybel only 2 from it'
10:59:28: You chat 'I'm upset lhuth's can't kill him.'
10:59:51: Ranak chats 'kill him on uruk or whitie, rent, wait 20, log lhuth'
11:00:01: Ranak chats 'piece of cake!'
11:00:04: You chat 'I was more upset it takes you insta awful, and he's aggy to you afterwards, and your spell never lands. :P'
11:00:20: Ranak chats 'is it insta awful?  hmmmmmmmmmm, i could probably change that lol'
11:00:31: You chat 'Took me to like, 2hp. :P'
11:00:33: Ranak chats 'brb'
11:00:45: Ranak chats 'no whities on'
11:01:05: You chat 'I do like that feature, but it feels borked with Lhuths. :p'
11:01:24: Ranak chats 'yeah skews it a little'
11:01:29: Ranak chats 'maybe with harads we'll add 3rd side?'
11:01:53: You chat 'I think that'd be neat.  I also feel like lhuth's aren't always picked up at all, though that could and most likely is just me.'
11:02:46: You chat 'Like, does it pick players up even if they're linkless?'
11:03:02: Ranak chats 'not if they're linkdead'
11:03:31: You chat 'Interesting.  I had another thing I wanted to test also.'
11:03:40: You chat 'It seemed like when I pdied, some items were moved from my pack to my corpse.'
11:04:05: You chat 'If that is indeed the case, I wonder if Dave handled the recursive side of it, with packs inside of packs.'
11:04:21: Ranak chats 'not sure, i've also noticed the same thing'
11:04:36: You chat 'Seemed like it was everything except food/water.'
11:09:18: You chat 'Were there any other "hidden" skills Lhuth's can learn besides track/slashing/concussion?'
11:09:26: Ranak chats 'that's it for now'
11:09:40: You chat 'Just checking to make sure nothing was missed. :)  It is technically plenty.'
11:10:03: Ranak chats 'there's the potential for more now that seth made the 'will teach' flag'
11:10:26: You chat 'Hmm.  That's going to leave me guessing. :P'
11:10:46: Ranak chats 'previous to that flag, guildmasters will teach to people they're friendly with'
11:10:51: Ranak chats 'causing an issue for beornings'
11:10:56: Ranak chats 'since, you could'
11:10:57: Ranak chats 'afk'
11:11:17: You chat 'What do you mean by you could AFK?'
11:12:37: Urgog chats 'sup fools'
11:12:37: You chat 'Think I misunderstood that you were going afk, and didn't mean that was a loophole. :P'
11:12:51: You chat 'Yo hooker face.'
11:13:04: Ranak chats 'back'
11:13:06: Ranak chats 'okay'
11:13:34: Ranak chats 'so, with beornings, the only way to keep them skill restricted was to make all guildmasters aggy to them'
11:13:36: Ranak chats 'even in whitie towns'
11:13:39: Ranak chats 'which makes no sense'
11:13:45: You chat 'So everything got flags'
11:13:49: You chat 'For which races they will teach to.'
11:13:58: Ranak chats 'they will, it's working on test right now'
11:14:00: Ranak chats 'not on live yet'
11:14:10: Ranak chats 'but what it'll allow, is a harad that can teach a lhugh some skill'
11:14:23: Ranak chats 'without giving lhuths access to the full ranger suite that harads will have'
11:14:37: You chat 'Ahh, so you're looking at ranger skills. :P'
11:14:44: You chat 'For lhuths. :P'
11:14:51: Ranak chats 'basically, this flag will let us do more quest shit and more trainers in a better way'
11:14:55: Urgog chats 'ambushing lhuths!'
11:15:09: Ranak chats 'possibly, that would be an addition after the 3 new races go in'
11:15:12: You chat 'I got ambushed sleeping 2 nights ago on this guy'
11:15:15: Ranak chats 'but we have that granularity now'
11:15:16: You chat 'From hurt-bloodied.'
11:15:23: You chat 'Whopping like, 40 hp. :P'
11:15:28: Ranak chats 'hahahaha'
11:15:37: Ranak chats 'i got ambushed to awful fro healthy'
11:15:51: You chat 'It was a player too.'
11:15:56: You chat 'Freya's darkie ranger.'
11:15:59: Ranak chats 'oof!'
11:16:02: Ranak chats 'what spec?'
11:16:02: You chat 'He was pissed. :P'
11:16:16: You chat 'Unsure, but he mentioned knowing stealth I believe.'
11:16:26: Ranak chats 'weird'
11:16:38: Ranak chats 'the coders might wanna take a look at that'
11:16:58: You chat 'Meh, I had shield spell up. :D'
11:16:58: Urgog chats 'vagor stabbed grudge to bruised too'
11:17:05: Urgog chats ':D'
11:17:08: Ranak chats 'vagor def isn't stealth spec tho'
11:17:12: You chat 'Ambush really is worthless without stealth spec, from what I hear.'
11:17:16: Urgog chats 'he knows stealth though'
11:17:38: Ranak chats 'i've killed too many things'
11:17:40: You chat 'If a skill suite is irrelevant unless you specialize in it, then it shouldn't be available until you specialize.'
11:17:48: Ranak chats 'i need to leave dfr area'
11:18:36: Ranak chats 'i'd disagree on that atomos, the stab was 100 hit points or so, so thats a mutilate.  also trap is some utility'
11:18:44: You chat 'Kenny, get that $$$?'
11:18:49: You chat 'I can't agree with that.'
11:18:50: Ranak chats 'dat paper'
11:18:54: You chat 'Ambush is avoidable'
11:18:59: You chat 'And requires a lot of time.'
11:19:07: You chat 'Hide hardly works in a lot of situations'
11:19:25: You chat 'There is too much playing against it vs. a hit from a warrior, and the warrior hardly misses. :O'
11:19:57: Urgog chats 'what do you mean hide hardly works? :S'
11:20:10: Urgog chats 'unless you're fighting a 24r+ hide always works'
11:20:15: You chat 'Without stealth spec, hide was weakened too, no?'
11:20:28: Ranak chats 'depends on what the person has pracced'
11:20:30: Urgog chats 'i've had 0 problems. except the 100% search problem which has always been a problem'
11:20:36: Ranak chats 'hide bash is brutal'
11:20:41: Ranak chats '30w 21r'
11:20:47: Ranak chats 'hide bash is comedy gold'
11:20:51: Urgog chats 'haha'
11:20:56: You chat 'We were comparing ambush to mutilates. :P'
11:21:06: Urgog chats 'right, so why bring up hide? :P'
11:21:08: You chat 'So hide bash is irrelevant, because you lose the ambush.'
11:21:12: You chat 'Because you can't ambush without hide.'
11:21:18: Urgog chats 'but hide always works'
11:21:22: Urgog chats 'hell, sneak hide always works'
11:21:26: You chat 'And hide is also searchable like, 100%'
11:21:37: Urgog chats 'yeah, i mentioned that :P'
11:21:44: Urgog chats 'reveal sucks ballz though'
11:22:00: You chat 'So ambushes are easily avoidable.  Once you eat 2, you're able to miss the next ones with relative ease, in a sense.'
11:22:01: Ranak chats 'it is my personal opinion that even if it's weaker, people should still have access to ambush'
11:22:13: You chat 'Well that wasn't my intended argument.'
11:22:24: You chat 'I'm saying it shouldn't be so weak that it should be placed in a spec, but that's where it sits. :P'
11:22:50: Ranak chats 'ahhhhhh, i see what you're saying'
11:22:56: Ranak chats 'and it could probably be fine tuned some more'
11:23:28: You chat '*nod* Almost that time of the year when Dave will be getting back to coding.'
11:23:30: Ranak chats 'but on the other hand, archery and animal spec are in REALLY good spots right now, so do they need another tool?'
11:24:05: You chat 'That's the problem, and why it'd nearly be worth moving ambush to stealth spec once spec is level 12.'
11:24:06: Urgog chats 'rangers aren't missing out on anything from it, swashes are though'
11:24:24: Urgog chats 'swashes got nerfed hard :P'
11:24:35: You chat 'Mages got nerfed hard in the early levels.'
11:24:44: You chat 'They truly are the hardest to XP up to level 15 now.'
11:24:51: Urgog chats 'light fighting is fun and all, but you need to get REALLY lucky to get those double/triple hits'
11:25:49: Ranak chats 'yeah, but light fighting is getting a buff with dual wielding, and low level mages gettnig a boost too'
11:26:05: Urgog chats 'tell dave to hurry up with that dual wielding :D'
11:26:20: You chat 'Dave will take as much time as he wants to take. :P'
11:26:22: Ranak chats 'totally valid points about ambush, but i'm cool with it being weaker for now, obviously need to rebalance it at some point'
11:26:39: You chat 'Dave has also mentioned scaling guardian'
11:26:57: You chat 'The guardian grows with the player, so guardian will be useful for lower mystics.'
11:27:40: You chat 'As it stands, it's the most pointless specialization because it's not one you can just choose regardless of class.  Most other spec skills are all level 0ish.'
11:28:45: Ranak chats 'true, but how powerful do you make it?  why spec animals, and prac animals, and prac tame, and prac calm?'
11:29:06: You chat 'It probably won't become more powerful.'
11:29:07: Ranak chats 'just cast a spell that can buff or hit or mental?'
11:29:10: You chat 'But it will get weaker.'
11:29:21: You chat 'And why do that with animals?'
11:29:31: You chat 'Because you can have more than 1, technically, if you lessen the level, and they're orderable'
11:29:37: You chat 'You can whistle to have them come back to you'
11:29:44: You chat 'They bash, kick, swing, pick, search, gather'
11:29:50: Ranak chats 'oh i don't have any answers, i'm just asking questions =)'
11:29:54: You chat ':P'
11:30:13: You chat 'Oh, and they rescue when and only when you want them to. :P'
11:30:34: Ranak chats 'well, they're writing a new program for the hitter guardians'
11:30:36: Ranak chats 'to not rescue'
11:30:54: You chat 'Oh, I thought that was in already.'
11:31:00: Ranak chats 'nosir!'
11:31:05: Ranak chats 'that's a whole new program to be written'
11:31:40: You chat 'And though big level tames aren't always "the best" in the categories, you can expect them to outhit an aggressive guardian, and buff almost as well as a defensive guardian, without switching.'
11:32:00: Ranak chats 'not true on the defensive part right now'
11:32:10: Ranak chats 'those defensive guardians have real good defsums'
11:32:13: You chat 'Yeah, that part is a tad sketchy, though they do have good HP.'
11:32:33: You chat 'Where an aggressive guardian will die in 1-2 hits. :P'
11:36:16: Ranak chats '150ish defsum with 225ish hit points for guardian def'
11:36:50: Ranak chats '110 def for a L19 tame'
11:36:58: You chat 'Not too shabby.  A little less, maybe, than you'd expect with a hybrid mystic/warrior|ranger'
11:37:29: Ranak chats 'i think, that one might be wrong though since i'm not sure if my spreadsheet is including stats or just the 'base' amount.'
11:37:31: Ranak chats 'wait'
11:37:34: Ranak chats 'no i think that's the real amount'
11:38:02: You chat 'Don't all tames differ now depending on animal type?'
11:38:09: Ranak chats 'i can't wait for poison lol'
11:38:15: You chat '? :O'
11:38:32: Ranak chats 'nope, just the top tier 17-18-19 were adjusted'
11:39:44: Ranak chats 'and actually, i think i left the silver haired bears alone'
11:39:51: Ranak chats 'i think i just adjust the 'special' tames that raziel made'
11:40:08: Ranak chats 'i.e. towering bear/brutal bull/ram/snow leopard/etc'
11:41:16: You chat 'Ah, interesting.'
11:41:36: You chat 'I thought massive silver haired and goldens were covered in that.'
11:41:46: Ranak chats 'goldens were too low'
11:42:39: Ranak chats 'i didn't to massives YET, because i wanted to introduce it slowly'
11:42:45: Ranak chats 'plus, if people xp on massives'
11:43:00: Ranak chats 'should they be getting + hit points'
11:43:10: Ranak chats 'PLUS i'd have to make them all 'no_recalc''
11:43:26: Ranak chats 'so they'd have to be manually adjusted should any mass change come down the line'
11:43:48: You chat '*nod*  All good.  My assumptions were wrong, but there is no impact to it. :P'
11:44:02: Ranak chats 'lol =)'
11:44:05: Ranak chats 'okay, another question'
11:44:26: Ranak chats 'what about huge warriors getting access to guardian?'
11:45:28: You chat 'Obviously depends on how big.  I think guardian would sit well at a level 18-21 mystic skill, affording a... well, 27W to perhaps a 30W to get a weak guardian.'
11:45:56: You chat 'I think the best benefactor for low level mystics would be a mental guardian to help spirit, because it's still a pain to spirit when you can't kill spirits.'
11:46:30: Ranak chats 'fair enough, lie i said, i don't hhave answers for these querstions, they're just important to think about'
11:47:41: You chat 'Yeah, and they're certainly tough questions to answer without seeing the full impact first hand.'
11:48:09: Ranak chats 'generally we consult drew about all  this stuff'
11:48:20: Ranak chats 'rather, we don't'
11:48:20: Ranak chats 'you know'
11:48:24: Ranak chats 'because illuminati'
11:48:25: You chat 'I feel like that's a bad thing to do as of late. :P'
11:48:43: You chat 'But really, something that scales nicely with tames in general would be worthwhile.'
11:49:00: You chat 'We see 30W 20R's all the time, and don't see them specializing in animals'
11:49:07: You chat 'Because it's too costly to lose wild fighting.'
11:50:38: You chat 'Ugh.  I keep forgetting that I start killing a warg... and then he heals.'
11:50:41: Ranak chats 'when does dark bolt become viable?'
11:50:57: You chat 'From what I understand, at about 12M it's manageable to an extend.'
11:50:59: You chat 'extent*'
11:51:03: Ranak chats 'gotta poison it'
11:51:07: Ranak chats 'then it doesn't regen lol'
11:51:11: You chat 'And works well against those wraiths in Durg's keep.'
11:51:19: You chat 'No sense.  4 spears kill them.'
11:51:28: Ranak chats 'hahahahaha look at you with mana for 4 spears'
11:51:31: You chat 'It can take 3-4 arrows just to get him poisoned, and to hurt. :P'
11:51:33: Ranak chats 'You have 89/91 hit, 23/81 stamina, '
11:51:42: You chat ':P'
11:51:52: You chat 'I need to get me some ruby rings'
11:51:58: Ranak chats 'leach is down to 15 mana....so i got that goin on'
11:52:00: You chat 'And really, another set of sticks for lowbies so I can actually keep this one.'
11:52:09: Ranak chats 'hahahaha well i can help with that'
11:52:10: You chat 'I talked with Dave about leach, and dark spec.'
11:52:29: You chat 'Leach is kind of a worthless skill in most situations, so I'd have liked to see some benefit to it with dark spec.'
11:52:46: Ranak chats 'for xping it's great?  especially if you're 'tanking' a mob for a 2nd lhuth'
11:52:47: You chat 'He's actually considering improving the healing effect (not the damage done) if going dark spec.'
11:52:55: Ranak chats 'that's how karvok and harvok leveled'
11:53:00: You chat 'I guess that's true. :O'
11:53:02: Ranak chats 'karvok blasted away with leaches'
11:53:07: Ranak chats 'harv did bolts'
11:53:12: You chat 'I'm not a lhuth master.'
11:53:24: You chat 'Sounds very reasonable though, but I see mana dropping quickly.'
