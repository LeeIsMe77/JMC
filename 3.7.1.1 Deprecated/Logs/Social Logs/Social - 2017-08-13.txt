09:09:25: You say 'I'll give you a do-all trigger.'
09:09:33: You say 'Gonna be hopping in the shower first, so I'll check back before I leave.'
09:09:45: Cadoc group-says 'bow'
09:09:47: You say 'Order me to do something'
09:10:09: You say 'Try now.'
09:10:55: You say 'Those spirits will probably help as well.'
09:11:05: Cadoc says 'i was thinking orc caves'
09:11:07: You say 'I'd like to see whities just stuck at +100 or more alignment some day.'
09:11:34: You say 'Really is a nuisance getting alignment back, and stops mystics from being playable. :P'
09:11:56: Cadoc says 'im up to 35k spirit tho so i wont have to worry about spiriting for a while'
09:12:01: You say 'And my idle trigger is now on, so I shouldn't disappear.'
09:12:27: Cadoc says 'you said cats is good?'
09:12:34: You say 'Cats was always the best place.'
09:12:37: Cadoc says 'thats where we go then'
09:12:46: You say 'I have a 125 wimpy as well.'
09:13:00: You say 'Keeping it kinda high for in case we hit that mage room or something.'
09:13:26: You say 'Back in a few.'
09:17:09: Cadoc says 'so far no alignment for these'
09:18:46: You say 'It'll be uruks, most likely, and the wraiths.'
09:19:03: You say 'Unless all of that has changed, which I certainly hope it hasn't.'
09:19:33: You say 'Laundry folded, now really getting in the shower. :P'
09:32:50: Cadoc says 'this is not helping :('
09:39:02: You say 'Any luck?'
09:39:31: You say 'Is it going up by 2 align each mob? :|'
09:39:53: Cadoc says 'nope'
09:39:58: You say 'Not doing anything?!'
09:39:59: Cadoc says '1 align every other mob it seems'
09:40:03: You say 'Oh.'
09:40:05: Cadoc says 'im down to 184 from 200'
09:40:12: Cadoc says 'thinking of going to hit forest trolls'
09:40:16: You say ''It speeds up at -99. :O'
09:40:25: You say '-99 is still neutral.'
09:40:51: You say 'I can't believe this though.  These used to be 2 align from -500'
09:41:02: You say 'Which speeds up again around -300 I think.'
09:41:12: Cadoc says 'must have changed it'
09:41:39: Cadoc says 'this mob is -2 align'
09:41:47: Cadoc says 'so is shackled troll'
09:42:01: Cadoc says 'that was 4 align actually'
09:45:09: You say 'Spirits?'
09:45:13: You say 'Do they do much?'
09:45:15: Cadoc says '+3'
09:45:26: You say 'Cool beans.'
09:45:32: Cadoc says 'beats a blank'
09:45:46: You say 'I gotta roll out now.  I'll be there in about 90 minutes.'
09:45:48: Cadoc says 'where did you guys find reverence at'
09:45:58: You say 'We went to get a phial for Cultists'
09:46:04: You say 'And caught him at slab.'
09:46:12: Cadoc says 'inside?'
09:46:13: You say 'He was hurt already, I believe.  He ate a spear from me, and bashed me'
09:46:17: You say 'Up from it.'
09:46:29: You say 'Then kenny walked in while I was bashed and landed 2 dbs I think'
09:46:32: You say 'And it killed him.'
09:46:35: You say 'Dude didn't flee. :P'
09:46:38: Cadoc says 'lol'
09:46:43: Cadoc says 'were you low at all'

09:47:13: You say 'So we snagged his. :P'
09:47:19: Cadoc says 'lol'
09:47:21: You say 'I'll give him a new one if I see him.'
09:47:24: You say 'But it's pretty easy to get.'
09:47:28: Cadoc says 'thats funny'
09:47:33: You say 'I made an assist trigger too.'
09:47:45: You say 'Ended up killing priest on lhuth in like, 5 minutes or less.'
09:47:52: You say 'Actually, it was more like, 2 minutes.'
09:47:54: Cadoc says 'the 2 women?'
09:47:59: You say 'Nah, the single guy'
09:48:05: Cadoc says 'ohh for ruby ring?'
09:48:11: You say 'The women... I still haven't thought of a way to do it short-handed'
09:48:14: You say 'And yes, ruby ring. :O'
09:49:01: You say 'Ugh, I hate driving to Baltimore sometimes.'
09:49:12: You say 'And I hate that I commit to doing something when I'm not sure I want to :P'
