11:22:15: Ranak chats 'i like it, that's half the reason i made him load good shit'
11:22:24: Eek chats 'heh, I got a fine blue robe out of the last time I was on when he came :)'
11:22:29: Eek chats 'I'm okay with him coming every day'

11:23:56: Ranak tells you 'he was on at the time maybe?'
11:24:04: You tell Ranak 'I guess that's a very logical answer.'
11:24:09: You tell Ranak 'And I am not very logical today.'
11:24:19: Ranak tells you 'for a programmer that's not a good thing lol'

11:24:53: Ranak chats 'any time i see people congregating in a certain place, i'm compelled to level a char on that side'
11:24:54: You chat 'It's amazing.  But really, considering a lot of people have been seeking PK and not finding it, lhuth will provide their PK. :)'

11:44:44: You chat 'Nitpicking like, 15,000+ lines of code is VERY difficult to do.  It's gotta be the worst job from my standpoint.'
11:44:58: Ranak chats '=|'
11:45:21: You chat 'They all just begin to blend together.'
11:47:01: Ranak chats 'i love dark bolt'

12:30:02: You chat 'They hit me about as much as a rabid black wolf'
12:30:08: Ranak chats 'but remember too, that dfr mobs are beefed up a bit in xp'

12:38:53: Ranak chats 'very true!'
12:38:55: You chat 'Omg that's genius!'
12:39:02: You chat 'If RotS had "Challenges"'
12:39:07: Ranak chats 'there kind of ARE lowbie smobs though, just highbies can kill them'
12:39:12: You chat 'For like, level 10/15/20/25/30'
12:39:53: You chat 'Physical challenge, tactical challenge, challenges based on different coef combinations.'
12:40:42: You chat 'Perhaps a way to earn some exploits and XP :O'
12:41:22: Ranak chats 'yeah but i just shuddered at the thought of thinking up and then writing...5 times 6, so 30 different challenges '
12:41:30: You chat 'And a mob in a town would initiate it, and perhaps teleport you to the challenge area.  Can't officially die, but if you do challenge is over.'
12:41:58: You chat 'Meh, the  only thing that may change is the mob(s) that loads. :O'
12:42:40: Ranak chats 'i'm gonna keep that idea in my back pocket, the newbie starting area i'm making will be a perfect testing ground for it'
12:42:58: You chat 'Oooh, newbie starting area? :O'
12:43:06: You chat 'Will it be race-neutral? Or aimed at new whities?'
12:43:11: Ranak chats 'new whities'
12:43:28: Ranak chats '2 main areas 1) completely new to muds and 2) new to rots'
12:43:39: Ranak chats 'completely optional'
12:43:40: You chat 'Sounds like a great idea.'
12:43:57: Ranak chats 'but we've had some brand new players, and vinyanost is a great starting place, but it's still assuming you have a lot of knowledge already'
12:43:58: You chat 'Would it be like a walk-through interactive tutorial?'
12:44:03: Ranak chats 'basically yes'
12:44:32: You say 'open'
12:44:50: You chat 'I like it. :)  Look at you always thinking.'
12:45:20: Ranak chats 'well i figure once new races are in and the starting area is done, we can legit start recruiting'
12:45:25: Ranak chats 'or at least, putting ourselves out there'
12:45:33: You chat 'It's funny'
12:45:41: You chat 'I got registered for a MUD account on that one website'
12:45:44: You chat 'topmudsites maybe'
12:45:53: You chat 'But you had to get approval for something else'
12:46:00: Ranak chats 'yes'
12:46:00: You chat 'And I requested it 4-5 months ago and never got a response. :P'
12:46:00: Ranak chats 'they never wrote back'
12:46:09: Ranak chats 'and i've sent like 3 updates'
12:46:16: Ranak chats 'er requests for updates'
12:46:55: You chat 'Would you guys be able to host a MVC website?'
12:47:07: Ranak chats 'what is mvc?'
12:47:14: You chat 'It's a Microsoft technology.'
12:47:32: You chat 'It can technically run on linux nowadays, but it'd be preferable to do Windows hosting.'
12:48:16: Ranak chats 'probably, but might not be a bad idea to do external hosting.  We talked about it, but don't really want a web server running on the host, well the hosts host i guess'
12:48:59: You chat 'Fair enough.  I have a server, but sure as shit don't want that loud thing running in my room.  On top of that, my bandwidth wouldn't handle any traffic, really. :P'
12:49:18: You chat 'But I'm about to move into web work soon, and need to begin learning.'
12:49:26: You chat 'So what better way than trying to get a rots website going?'
12:50:18: Ranak chats 'i'm all for it'
12:50:47: Ranak chats 'would it be better to just use a hosted service?'
12:50:54: Ranak chats 'it's not like the website will have stupid traffic running to it'
12:51:15: Ranak chats 'probably pretty cheap to just buy a domain name and a virt server?'
12:51:25: Ranak chats 'depending on how much, i'd of course be willing to foot the bill'
12:51:31: You chat 'Perhaps.  I don't know what costs are like for that.'
12:51:39: You chat 'If it came down to it, Kenny may even be able to have his work host it.'
12:52:19: You chat 'Think I'ma run and grab lunch from Chipotle. :O'
12:52:25: Ranak chats 'lucky'
13:03:49: Ranak chats 'i don't know why i'm looting gold...'

13:17:14: Ranak chats 'i'll have to fix that when harads go in'
13:17:22: You chat 'To not sell? :P'
13:17:23: Ranak chats 'harads gonna have a vendor for lhuths'
13:17:26: Ranak chats 'yeah'

13:17:42: You chat 'I'm interested in seeing the impact of being in the far reaches of SE mirkwood.'
13:17:54: Ranak chats 'well and that's just on paper, it's the place where they're supposed to go'
13:18:04: Ranak chats 'but the design philosophy from a design standpoint is to  keep putting things close to dfr'
13:18:06: You chat 'I'm definitely not opposed to it.'
13:19:19: Ranak chats 'trolls are going near dfr and beorns are going in carrock (their natural home anyway)'
13:19:23: You chat 'I'm also interested in the story to come of how they forged a relationship to work together. :O'
13:19:36: Ranak chats 'naerling zone is going near fungal'
13:19:51: Ranak chats 'mewlip zone is going between lhuth caves and dark lake'
13:20:06: You chat 'Naerling?  I'm not familiar with those.'
13:20:19: Ranak chats 'i think rots made them up?'
13:20:26: Ranak chats 'there's some that load in vale'
13:20:27: You chat 'Is it a race, or mobs?'

13:22:00: Maga chats 'How goes it?'
13:22:02: Ranak chats 'i decided yesterday that lhuths get a +5 int race bonus.  retroactive'
13:22:15: Ranak chats 'so if you just wanna set my int up 5 that'd be great'
13:22:18: You chat 'I decided I agree with that.'
13:22:21: Ranak chats 'hahahhahaha'
13:22:23: Maga chats 'Cool cool cool...'
13:22:42: You chat 'Afterall, it's what the original programmers had intended.'
13:22:48: Ranak chats 'DEFINITELY!'
13:23:20: Maga chats 'Ah I see that now, in the 1 million+ lines of code that's undocumented :p'
13:23:37: You chat 'Ahh, you got it!'

14:06:08: You chat 'Until out VPN internet drops, and I'm forced to go back to my local internet and play games until it comes back up.'
14:06:15: You say 'open'
14:07:09: Ranak chats 'hahahahaha'
14:07:19: You chat ':D'
14:07:20: Ranak chats 'why vpn internet?'
14:07:32: You chat 'I like stealing my works IP address instead of using my own.'
14:07:55: You chat 'And really, for some of the stuff I do it's required I'm in the domain to get access to services.'
14:08:15: You chat 'Right now I'm fixing a bug in our VSTO (Excel Addin) application, which requires domain access. :P'
14:08:32: Ranak chats 'ahhhhh, for work, i gotcha'
14:09:16: You chat 'It is quite funny though.  I forget to log out of the VPN sometimes, which isn't bad.'
14:09:32: You chat 'But I learned that Diablo is horrible at handling exceptions when they're blacklisted by our firewall.'
14:10:51: Ranak chats 'HAHAHAHAHAHA'
14:11:26: You chat 'You know, not that I would ever play during work hours.'

14:31:55: Ranak chats 'i don't think it's mana efficient tho?'
14:32:03: Ranak chats 'for 50% mana i don't think it does 50'
14:32:06: Ranak chats '% more damage?'
14:32:06: You chat 'I don't understand why everyone stands by dark bolt so hard.  With how resists are right now with mages, spear is the go-to'
14:32:15: Ranak chats 'although maybe it does with resist'
14:32:33: You chat 'Mobs resist WAY too much for me to consider dark bolt a great spell compared to spear. :P'
14:32:36: You chat 'In PK, sure.'
14:33:27: You chat 'It could just be me not really ever playing a darkie caster before, and perhaps I'm a bit naive.'
14:34:06: Ranak chats 'i guess i just see people casting when i'm on imm and dark bolt + dark spec non resisted is pretty fuckin rough'
14:34:46: Ranak chats 'You receive your share of experience -- 2591 points.'
